"May 02, 2019 09:03 am +08",TM,"Valuation needed for new houses — experts","KUALA LUMPUR: House buyers stand to benefit if primary market residential properties too, and not just secondary properties, are required to have a valuation done, say experts.Noting that new houses are currently priced at the sole discretion of developers, they said an independent valuation will help ensure fairer prices.They were commenting on the call for improved housing valuation methods by Khazanah Research Institute (KRI) in its report on the state of housing released last week.The report said the sales comparison approach (where the last transacted price of a house determines the value of a new comparable house in an area) currently used should be complemented with the cost approach (where the price is equal to the cost to build an equivalent property).“One of the weaknesses of the sales comparison approach is that the rapid escalation of house prices is sometimes the result of speculative activities,” it noted.Michael Kong, president of the Association of Valuers, Property Managers, Estate Agents and Property Consultants in the Private Sector, said the report seems to assume that developers are pricing their properties based on valuations done.“That is not true. Valuers are not involved in the developers’ pricing,” Kong told The Edge Financial Daily.He said overpricing occurs when primary market properties are sold at high prices, as developers have the sole discretion in determining the prices.A property sector analyst with an investment bank research house, who declined to be named, concurred with this view. She said the issue arises when the value of a unit of property at completion is lower than the initial price at its launch.This, she said, is due to the fact that the valuation method adopted by property developers to price their products is inconsistent with how valuers appraise the same unit if it were to be sold on the secondary market.“Malaysia has been fortunate as the House Price Index has been relatively stable and has been on an upward linear trajectory so far. So previously, homebuyers and investors who bought properties during its launching anticipated that they can at least sell the properties with 20% to 30% profit at completion. But the property market is soft now. It doesn’t work like that anymore,” said the analyst.“This disparity of valuation method between the primary and the secondary market is the crux of the issue,” she added in a phone interview.The analyst did not push for any particular valuation method to be adopted, but called for a standardised method that is endorsed by the government. This is so that the same valuation method is applied across the board.“This issue should be addressed through regulatory measures by the government. It doesn’t matter which method (is used), as long as it is consistent and comprehensive,” she said.The Valuation and Property Services Department (JPPH) has cautioned against adopting the cost approach for property valuation.“The cost method is a last resort ... because value is not equal to cost,” JPPH director Ahmad Zailan Azizuddin said last Friday at the launch of the National Property Information Centre’s (Napic) 2018 Property Market Report.According to Kong, Napic data may not be the best representation of Malaysian house prices as rebates and discounts offered by developers are often not captured in sales and purchase agreements, which are the data recorded by Napic.“This distorts official data on the property market,” he said.Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng, also speaking at the launch of the Napic report, stressed the need for a reduction in the gap between property valuations made by the public and private sectors.“I believe if there are clear SOPs (standard operating procedures), then the gap in property prices will not be so wide,” he said.Referring to KRI’s recommendation, the minister said the argument for the adoption of the cost valuation method needs to be discussed among stakeholders before a final decision can be made.Ahmad Zailan said the department routinely engages with surveyors and valuers in the private sector, and that while JPHH is concerned about the gap, it is “not too big.”“As a government valued (method), we adhere to standards. We share the same standards and principles as the private sector, but with a difference in opinion,” he said. Transparency needed on costsWhile Ahmad Zailan described property valuation as “both an art and a science”, KRI is quick to point out the difficulty in assessing the true costs of properties as stakeholders, including developers, have been reluctant to elaborate on their costs.Lee Heng Guie, executive director of the Socio-Economic Research Centre, said managing cost structures is often the competitive advantage of most developers, making it less likely that they would be willing to share such information.But KRI chairman Dr Nungsari Ahmad Radhi said “the real issue” is price discovery, as the prices of a developer’s new products depend very much on the valuation of sub-sale units in the surrounding area.“The [valuation] decision on one acre influences the next one … regardless of [development] cost. It becomes an auction,” Nungsari said during the launch of the KRI report.This is the key reason the think tank has recommended that an independent valuer be appointed for house purchases, not only during the application of bank loans but also to derive the true values of houses.According to Kong, the ease of obtaining bank facilities has also left developers unchecked.“Bank Negara Malaysia used to require developers to conduct market studies before banks could approve financing for their developments. Now that is no longer a compulsory practice. But the instructions should come from (the) banks,” he said.However, developers have often blamed high compliance costs for rising house prices, including the cost of building infrastructure for utility companies without being compensated.Datuk Soam Heng Choon, president of the Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association, referred to a case where a developer acquired a piece of land in Kuala Lumpur at a high cost.When the plan was submitted to the city council, it was imposed with RM24 million development charges, which translated to around RM30 per plot ratio or over RM300 per sq ft, Soam said at the KRI report launch.The KRI report, however, stated that limited data indicated both compliance and contribution costs are only a small fraction of total development costs, while costs caused by delays in development approvals have been addressed through improvements in the One-Stop Centre portal“Data from the Construction Industry Development Board and Napic indicate that house prices in Malaysia have almost doubled since 2008 while construction costs — labour, material and machinery, and equipment — have increased only slightly in the same period,” the report said.In fact, for affordable housing schemes, Housing and Local Government Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin said all the compliance costs have to be absorbed by the government agency responsible for the scheme. This includes the construction of utilities such as Telekom Malaysia Bhd communication infrastructure and Tenaga Nasional Bhd power stations.“There were concerns that the agency might not have the money to absorb the costs on their own, but I have talked to some of the developers and I have suggested that they incur the costs first and collect them later from the government because the government will be the one collecting the bills.“We will come up with a mechanism but whatever it is, we are trying to reduce the construction cost so that prices of houses will not be too high,” she told the media on Monday.“The property developers should not include compliance expenses in the construction cost to the price of the house for affordable housing,” she added. Government intervention a must for affordable housingZuraida said prices of affordable homes under the newly introduced National Affordable Housing Policy will be determined by taking into consideration the median income of a particular area, which could go as low as RM90,000 per unit and up to RM300,000.“We are going to monitor the prices of houses according to the median income of the area. So that is one form of control. Therefore, they (property developers) cannot go more than what the affordability rate of the people in that area,” she said.If the property developers do not follow the price guideline set by the ministry, Zuraida said those projects would not be approved.“With the median price, they (property developers) will have no choice but to follow (the guideline). If they don’t accept the median price, then I won’t give them the job, simple as that,” she stressed.When asked if this would interfere with the free market convention of demand and supply to determine the pricing, Zuraida said, “As far as the affordable homes are concerned, I don’t think it’s interference, because it is what we want to give to the people. But if [they’re] private [projects] then we are not concerned with how they price their properties.”According to JPPH’s Ahmad Zailan, the cost valuation approach may in fact be most practical for affordable housing developments.While he acknowledged that it is a challenge to secure the correct figures from parties that are currently not transparent with their costs, he believes that it is possible to succeed with firm government intervention.“There needs to be a strong policy,” Ahmad Zailan said.On the demand side, the finance minister has repeatedly called on banks to be more flexible in disbursing loans, even suggesting progressive interest rates on repayments for housing loans.“If borrowers are facing [payment] pressures, they can move to progressive payment schemes to pay more in later years,” he said.However, KRI highlighted that Malaysians’ high household debt of RM1.1 trillion or 88.4% of gross domestic product as at the end of 2016 largely comprises borrowings for house purchases. It also noted that the US sub-prime crisis showed that loans extended to people who cannot afford to pay for them are highly detrimental to the wider economy.“Against the backdrop of high debt levels, rises in property prices that are not supported by fundamentals can be a potential source of risk to financial stability,” KRI said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/valuation-needed-new-houses-%E2%80%94-experts

That implies a 10% to 16% return from Friday’s close.Malaysian stocks have bucked the global rally this year, losing more than 3% in 2019 while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 11%. An economic growth slowdown and uncertainty over the new administration’s policies led to US$4.4 billion of equity outflows in the past 12 months.Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has shown signs of moving away from his earlier budget-cutting stance to revive large state projects and seek foreign investments. Malaysia struck a deal with China to resume the East Coast Rail Link at a lower cost and revived the US$34 billion property and transport hub Bandar Malaysia.“Fiscal stimulus, per resurrection of ECRL and Bandar Malaysia projects, is returning, oil prices are exceeding target and liquidity is ample,” the bank said in the report. “Government policy-centric catalytic news flow alone could allow the KLCI to recover to 12-month highs of 1,850.”Macquarie expects similar developments to happen with MRT 3 and the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail project, as well as in the telecom sector and within the Petroliam Nasional Bhd group of companies.The KLCI is showing some signs of a revival. It climbed 1% last week, halting five straight weeks of declines, the longest stretch of losses since 2015.The main risk remains Malaysia’s potential exclusion from FTSE Russell’s World Government Bond Index, which could lead to US$23 billion of government bond outflows as other index providers follow suit and worsen foreign selling in the country’s equities, the bank said.The investment bank prefers “yield-resilient” plays, corporate banks, government-linked companies:",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysias-stock-market-might-turn-corner-soon-macquarie-says

(April 24, RM1.11)
Maintain hold with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM1.15: CapitaLand Malaysia Mall Trust’s (CMMT) core net profit (CNP) for the first financial quarter of 2019 (1QFY19) of RM32.5 million (-12.8% year-on-year [y-o-y]) was slightly below our and consensus’ expectations. Overall decrease in 1QFY19 was mainly due to lower contributions from its Klang Valley malls, but partially mitigated by higher rental rates achieved from Gurney Plaza (GP) and East Coast Mall (ECM). 
We cut our forecasts slightly and is reflected in annual report figures which show a revised earnings per share (EPS) for 2019 and 2020 to -3.5% and -7.5% respectively. Following the dovish tone by major central banks and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), we revise our 10-year Malaysian Government Securities yield assumption to 3.9% (from 4.1%) and roll forward valuation to mid financial year 2020 (FY20).We maintain a “hold” call with an unchanged TP of RM1.15 based on the targeted yield of 6% (from 6.2%).CMMT’s 1QFY19 revenue of RM87.9 million (+1.1% quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q], -2% y-o-y) translated into a CNP of RM32.5 million (+0.6% q-o-q, -12.8% y-o-y). The results were slightly below our and consensus’ expectations with 23.4% and 22% respectively. The deviation was due to lower-than-expected revenue contribution.Q-o-q, total revenue for 1QFY19 of RM87.9 million increased by 1.1% compared with RM86.9 million in the previous quarter.CNP also increased by 0.6% to RM32.5 million from RM32.3 million in 4QFY18. The increase was thanks to improved performance from GP and ECM. CMMT incurred RM14.4 million capital expenditure during the quarter, mainly attributed to the Jumpa (the annex building of Sungei Wang (SW) with 170,000 sq ft of net lettable area) retail layout design and reconfiguration works at SW, enhancement works on the F&B area at The Mines (TM) and tenancy works at ECM.Y-o-y, RM87.9 million revenue decreased (-2%), followed by a decrease of CNP to RM32.5 million (-12.8%). The decline was mainly due to lower revenue caused by (i) lower occupancy rate at SW, TM and 3 Damansara, (ii) lower rental rates and downtime from asset enhancement initiative (AEI) works at SW and TM, and (iii) absence of a one-off forfeiture of deposit and compensation of premature termination of a mini anchor tenant at SW in 1QFY18.Nevertheless, the decrease was slightly mitigated by the improved performance from GP and ECM upon completion of its AEI works, and full occupancy attained at Tropicana City Office Tower.Finance costs were higher by 1.5%, given the increased average cost of debt post overnight policy rate hike as well as higher interest expenses from additional debt drawn down for capital expenditure works. Average cost of debt for 1QFY19 stood at 4.47% (1QFY18: 4.44%).Occupancy rate dropped slightly to 92.5% (FY18: 93.2%), while gearing increased slightly to 33.8% (FY18:32.5%).Jumpa began its AEI works since 2Q18 and it is expected to be completed by end of the first half of 2019. It is scheduled for a soft opening in 3Q19. To date, Jumpa has advanced leasing negotiations that exceeds 50%.We cut our earnings forecasts slightly as well as updated our projection based on FY18 audited account. As a result, FY19-FY20 EPS were revised by -3.5% and -7.5% respectively. — Hong Leong Investment Bank Research, April 24",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/gurney-plaza-ecm-help-mitigate-cmmts-lower-earnings

We understand and accept the importance of this connectivity,” he said in a special interview in conjunction with the one-year anniversary of the Pakatan Harapan government administration at his office in Wisma Angkasapuri today.According to Gobind, the proposal had been discussed with the Minister of Housing and Local Government (Zuraida Kamaruddin), and there were suggestions to ensure all buildings in new development projects, be it residential or office, be equipped with Internet access.Meanwhile, Gobind also drew attention to efforts by his Ministry to lower the Internet service charges so that everyone would have similar access to world technology with global-standard Internet speed and benefit various sectors, like agriculture, farming, medical, transport and e-commerce projects.“In Malaysia, there is no official Internet speed limit for the people that we can say that we have successfully created a good infrastructure. Unofficially, we have 30 mps, and at the time, we set it, how do we reach that level and at the same time reduce the cost of broadband.“So, when we introduce new prices under the National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP), we’ll see that the broadband price reducing. Prices have gone down in some cases, almost more than half. But on average among four telcos, it has come down almost at 50 percent,” he said.Among the main objectives of the NFCP existence is to achieve a baseline of 98 percent broadband coverage in inhabited areas by 2023, with a minimum broadband speed of 30 mbps so that 5G can be effectively implemented nationwide, especially in remote areas.Meanwhile, asked about reports his Ministry received regarding Internet and speed, Gobind said although he had announced the ministry’s objectives, it would still take time to be fully implemented.“We already have the data and we have found ways to solve it. We need to take some time. Of course there are efforts being implemented in the improvement process. For example, for Streamyx, we have discussed with TM.“It’s just that it’s not time yet to make an announcement. In two to three weeks’ time, hopefully we can make an announcement and resolve all these problems as fast as we can,” he added.Gobind said Internet and connectivity were among his main focus in ensuring that the infrastructure was enjoyed and utilised and that all the problems arising, such as cost and speed, had been resolved since he took over the ministry 11 months ago.“The 5G (Fifth Generation) pioneer project is a part of that (objective). It is also linked with the expansion of NFCP, which is related to infrastructure and bringing about change.“We must accept the fact that 10 to 20 years ago, that technology may have been key, but today the speed is slow, not reaching the level it should. Because of that, through NFCP, we focus on overcoming this problem and also build a more effective network system,” he said.He stressed that the connectivity factor was crucial in giving the public access to various information and future success, apart from increasing knowledge in all fields related to their lives.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/internet-connectivity-be-listed-utility-%E2%80%94-gobind

We have already done a commercial deployment of a pre-5G network a month ago, which allows us to test all the different variables that will be required when we go live for 5G,” said Nazeem, adding that there is no concrete timeline at the moment for 5G deployment.When asked about the earnings impact from the eventual 5G roll-out, he said it is too early to assess, and that he believes the impact would be bigger on TM’s customers, especially businesses including small and medium enterprises, and the way they conduct their business.In the meantime, as to whether TM is looking at expanding its pre-5G network sites beyond the mixed-used development of SetiaWalk Puchong, which it launched in March as its first pre-5G network in Malaysia, Nazeem said the group is getting feedback from customers and will select areas it believes best warrant the expansion.Mahmoud Dasser, the vice president cum chief marketing officer of TM One — TM’s enterprise and public-sector business solutions arm — added that the implementation of 5G will result in a shift of focus to the number of connections, compared to subscribers.“5G is really about machine-to-machine connectivity. We will have to start tracking ... the number of machines connecting to 5G and the productivity levels linked to their connection to the network,” said Mahmoud.When asked if TM would be looking at other 5G partners besides Chinese telco Huawei, Nazeem said it is too early to tell what decision the group would take on the matter.“The current showcase is powered by our partner, Huawei, but the real deployment is something we need to finalise once this project (the implementation of TM’s 5G network) gets going,” added Nazeem.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tm-says-5g-new-growth-area

This means investors should be looking for stocks that have good growth prospects or strong fundamentals.“If the [share] price is attractive and [the company’s] growth [prospects] are good, then it will serve as a buying opportunity,” he added.The FBM KLCI fell to a fresh two-year low last Thursday, closing at 1,624.23 points, as heightened concerns over slower global economic growth prompted investors to seek refuge in safe havens. The benchmark index inched up 5.94 points or 0.37% to close at 1,630.17 last Friday.Last week’s downward revision of the 2019 global growth forecast by the International Monetary Fund to 3.3% from 3.5% did not help matters. The fund had earlier this year revised down its growth forecast from 3.6%.Nomura head of equity research for Malaysia Tushar Mohata agrees that now is not the right time to turn to defensive stocks.That is because the defensive stocks on Bursa Malaysia have underperformed their Asean counterparts “significantly” due to strong outflows from foreign portfolio investors, he said.According to last Monday’s fund flow report by MIDF Research, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, foreign funds have sold RM1.76 billion net of local equities. Among the four Asean markets (Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines) it monitors, Malaysia has now surpassed Thailand to become the nation with the largest foreign net outflow.“Investors may want to consider looking at high beta stocks, which are trading at steep discount to their long-term average trading multiples. The near-term catalysts of these stocks could be improving earnings momentum,” said Tushar.He believes that these high beta stocks are likely to rally when Bursa reverses course and outperforms its peers in Asean.His top picks are CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Gamuda Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd.For investors who want exposure to defensive sectors, Tushar pointed out that real estate investment trusts (REITs) are one due to their stable yield.RHB Research Institute head of Malaysian research Alexander Chia said for domestic investors that need to remain invested in local equities, the preservation of capital will be a key priority.“Adding some defensive names to one’s portfolio continues to make tactical sense, given the prevailing risks that are still unfolding. These companies should have strong earnings resilience that can ride through market upheavals,” he added.Chia is recommending stocks such as Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Mynews Holdings Bhd, Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd and QL Resources Bhd.However, in the short term, Chia said investors should be aware of the persistent selling by foreign portfolio investors and hence, be wary of stocks with large foreign shareholdings.He also noted that only large-cap stocks have underperformed this year, while small-cap stocks have performed well.YTD, the FBM Small Cap Index has risen 18.29% to close at 13,365.62 points last Friday, while the KLCI has fallen 3.57%.Noting that it is a trading market now, Chia said funds need to make money and achieve alpha or active returns on their investments.“The market is now very short-term and the valuation [of Malaysian stocks] is not that cheap even at current levels,” he added.Hence, he opined that investors should look for pockets of opportunity, beaten down stocks, value buys and undervalued stocks. Silver lining in defensive stocksWhile current market conditions have not been really positive and it is seen that even defensive stocks have been underperforming so far this year, analysts still see some silver lining in defensive stocks.UOB Kay Hian Malaysia research head Vincent Khoo expects defensive stocks to underperform the broader market in the near term, as the government steps up fiscal stimulus activities via megaprojects.This is also to respect the sanctity of government contracts, especially pertaining to its proposed acquisition of Gamuda’s highways, he said.“In such a scenario, we foresee improved investor confidence and foreign equity flows turning positive,” he added.However, there are still some defensive stocks which continue to have modest appeal and these include high dividend yielders such as IGB REIT and Magnum Bhd.Khoo said stocks that will continue to remain attractive include selective beneficiaries of megaprojects and trade diversion.Meanwhile, stocks to avoid include selective glove manufacturers as clarity on demand and supply dynamics is needed; selective technology companies on the back of anticipated weak first quarter of 2019 results season; and Telekom Malaysia Bhd where UOB Kay Hian will need to assess the magnitude of its fall in broadband access average revenue per user.MIDF Research head Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman is of the view that defensive stocks can still be a safe haven when it comes to consumer consumption and dividend play.In relation to consumption, he noted that the distributive trade was still growing at 6.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) in February, albeit moderating from 7.8% y-o-y in the previous month, due to a shorter month and the festive holidays.Retail growth was 8.5% y-o-y, while wholesale and motor vehicles grew 5.8% y-o-y and 2.4% y-o-y respectively.“This shows consumption remains strong among Malaysians,” said Redza.He said stocks with “still strong earnings”, coupled with stable dividend payments, should also be considered amid these trying times.“Companies with strong earnings would provide a stable flow of future dividends and with market sentiment negatively affecting the price movements, this could present a good opportunity to accumulate stocks with high dividend yields.“So, investors shouldn’t just look at historical dividend payments alone; they also have to look at the defensiveness of the companies’ profits,” he added.MIDF Research is recommending stocks such as DiGi.Com Bhd, MBM Resources Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and UOA Development Bhd.Despite concerns over a potential cut in the overnight policy rate by Bank Negara Malaysia, which may negatively impact banks’ profitability, Redza also likes CIMB and Malayan Banking Bhd, noting that their share prices have fallen a lot over the past year.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/when-defensive-stocks-are-no-longer-bearmarket-safe-haven

He also served as CEO of Natseven TV Sdn Bhd.Sime Darby Property declined to comment on the matter when contacted, while Boustead has yet to respond to The Edge Financial Daily at the time of writing.Meanwhile, Lodin, upon vacating the Boustead group MD’s seat on Dec 31, 2018, has also vacated the vice chairman’s post at Boustead Plantations Bhd, together with the executive chairman’s position at Boustead Heavy Industries Corp Bhd and the non-executive chairman’s post at Pharmaniaga Bhd.The changes were due to early mutual termination of Lodin’s service agreement with Boustead, the holding company for the three other entities, after he stepped down as CEO of the Armed Forces Fund Board (LTAT) in September last year and as deputy chairman at Affin Holdings Bhd, which is controlled by LTAT, on Oct 28.Lodin had served as Boustead MD since 1991, and helmed LTAT since 1985.After the Pakatan Harapan government took over the federal administration following the 14th general election in May last year, other government-related entities that saw changes in leadership include Telekom Malaysia Bhd, FGV Holdings Bhd, Lembaga Tabung Haji, Khazanah Nasional Bhd, Permodalan Nasional Bhd, Bursa Malaysia Bhd and Malaysia Airport Holdings Bhd.Boustead suffered a net loss of RM469.2 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018, compared to a net profit of RM436.2 million reported in the previous year.This was mainly because of net losses it reported in the fourth quarter, with the group posting a RM455 million net loss due to provisions and impairments in its heavy industries division and plantation losses, while other divisions also reported lacklustre results.Boustead has warned of another tough year in 2019.In February this year, the group announced its plan to dispose of the Royale Chulan Bukit Bintang Hotel to Singapore-based Hotel Royal Ltd for RM197 million cash. On March 15, it inked a sale and purchase agreement to effect the sale.Boustead shares yesterday closed two sen lower at RM1.23, giving it a market capitalisation of RM2.49 billion.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/sime-darby-propertys-amrin-said-be-new-boustead-boss

"March 29, 2019 14:00 pm +08",TM,"Special Report: Saving Malaysia Airlines, again","SHOULD the government choose to shut it down, Malaysia Airlines Bhd will go down as the first national airline in Asia to go bust (Japan Airlines emerged from bankruptcy after two years), joining the ranks of its European counterparts such as Sabena, Air Berlin, Alitalia and Cyprus Airways.The flag carrier, which saw Khazanah Nasional Bhd pay RM1.38 billion to take it private in August 2014 and reboot it into a smaller airline under its current name in September 2015, is once again facing an uncertain future after Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad remarked last week that shutting it down was one option being considered by the government. Selling the national asset and refinancing its debts are two other possibilities the government will explore, he said.The prime minister’s warning comes as calls for the beleaguered airline to be wound down intensified in the past few weeks. The airline’s woes flared up on March 5 after its sole shareholder Khazanah reported its first annual loss in over a decade, mainly due to a RM3.7 billion writedown of Malaysia Airlines’ value last year.It doesn’t help matters that the airline missed its target to return to the black last year and, according to Centre for Aviation (CAPA) chief analyst and chief representative for Southeast Asia Brendan Sobie, will find it difficult to achieve profitability, at least in the near future, given current market conditions.On March 1, the private company revealed that it finished 2018 with a marginally lower loss compared to a year ago but it did not disclose the figures.Filings with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) show that Malaysia Airlines’ net loss increased by 85% year on year to RM812.11 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY2017). It has lost RM2.35 billion between 2015 and 2017.While it did not disclose its exact revenue for FY2018 except to say that it grew by 1% y-o-y, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that revenue rose to RM8.76 billion from RM8.67 billion in FY2017. It has yet to file its financial statements for FY2018 with SSM.Malaysia Airlines blamed FY2018’s poor performance on crew shortage, intense competition, oversupply of capacity and volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange.It is worth noting that when the 12-point MAS Recovery Plan (MRP) was conceived in 2014, fuel price was US$75.68 per barrel. As at March 8, 2019, the International Air Transport Association jet fuel price monitor was up 3.5% at US$80.30 per barrel from a year ago.The ringgit had also weakened by 3.6% to 4.9% to 4.0910 against the US dollar last Thursday. Khazanah’s assumption under the five-year recovery plan was that the local currency would range from 3.90 to 3.95.Still, critics point to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, which turned things around with a HK$2.3 billion profit last year after three years of heavy losses and Singapore Airlines (SIA), which managed to turn in a net profit of S$284 million for the third financial quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, amid the challenging operating environment. Khazanah seen more willing to give up the flag carrierAfter not one but four failed attempts at restructuring the national carrier and setting it on a path to sustainable profitability, including during the 42 years when it was known as Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), the calls are growing louder for the government to shut it down for good.Its weak financial health — even after a RM6 billion injection from Khazanah in 2014 — also makes it a prime target when Malaysia’s new government is looking to trim its huge debt of RM1.087 trillion as at Dec 31, 2018.Indeed, some analysts say the timing of Khazanah’s RM3.7 billion impairment charge on Malaysia Airlines in 2018 is an indication that it may be ready to end or sell its loss-making unit.HLIB Research aviation analyst Daniel Wong notes that Malaysia Airlines is not part of Khazanah’s core portfolio, suggesting that the state investment firm would be willing to part with its airline business if the investment does not make financial sense and assuming government approval is granted.“While we do not doubt Malaysia Airlines is a pride to Malaysia as the national carrier has been around since 1947, we remain doubtful of Khazanah’s willingness and ability to sustain the continued losses of Malaysia Airlines. The losses of Malaysia Airlines may amount to RM1 billion per year,” he says in a March 13 report. Malaysia Airlines can still fly highOnce-troubled flag carriers such as British Airways (BA), Japan Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Qantas Airways are living proof that Malaysia Airlines still has a chance of turning around, says a senior aviation consultant who declined to be named.A multitude of factors have contributed to Malaysia Airlines’ financial woes, but foremost among them is the lack of autonomy to run the business without government intervention, say airline experts and analysts.“There are no obvious or easy solutions and there are so many external factors that will impact Malaysia Airlines’ future financials. However, there are areas for potential improvement,” CAPA’s Sobie tells The Edge.“While the latest restructuring went much deeper than previous attempts, it didn’t go deep enough and address all the legacy issues. The airline could potentially take another crack at reducing its costs but this can only be effective if there is no political interference.“It could also relook its commercial and network strategy. Evolving into more of a regional airline could be an option,” he says.Sobie points out that while shutting down the airline is obviously politically difficult and has never really been an option, it now seems that it is being seriously considered.“There would still be sufficient competition in the market (even with Malaysia Airlines gone) and the void would likely be filled by the existing or new competitors. Keep in mind there were only two (Malaysia-based) players (Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia Group Bhd) before Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd was launched five years ago. However, another restructuring would still likely be the preferred option politically,” he adds.Transport infrastructure consultancy Modalis Infrastructure Partners associate director Khair Mirza believes Malaysia Airlines can thrive given a level playing field.“By definition, GLCs (government-linked companies) need to play a dual role. So, as long as it has a level playing field against other carriers, it can succeed, like how Qantas, Turkish Airlines and Garuda have all succeeded,” he adds.Khair points out that Malaysia Airlines is the only recognised strategic GLC that faces unfettered competition while trying to balance a social equity role. “It’s like asking an elephant to climb up a coconut tree just because the monkey has glorified climbing trees.”Meanwhile, a senior aviation consultant notes that the government must also ensure that Malaysia Airlines has the right people on its board of directors to steer the airline.“The board has had many of the same members for several years despite losses. It is good to have new people with fresh ideas to help move Malaysia Airlines forward.“It is also good to have a combination of some with overall airline industry experience (at least two to three years) and some good professionals in finance and law,” he adds.The consultant also points out that the airline must have the right people in senior management. “Malaysia Airlines CEO Izham Ismail should be given a chance to carry on and he deserves the freedom to name his own team,” he says.Modalis’ Khair concurs, noting that a shake-up of the eight-member board is long overdue.He also believes that it is time to allow Malaysia Airlines to award contracts based on competitive bidding rather than “giving contracts to non-strategic investees that have bloated into public-listed entities, squeezing out bona fide market participants”. A case in point is the RM42.99 million three-year contract bagged by UEM Edgenta Bhd’s 80%-owned subsidiary KFM Holdings Bhd in June 2016 to provide facility management services to Malaysia Airlines via direct negotiation.A check on Malaysia Airlines website reveals that its board comprises one executive director —  Izham — and seven non-executive directors, namely Tan Sri Krishnan Tan Boon Seng, Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, David Lau Nai Pek, Dr Mohamadon Abdullah, Sheranjiv M Sammanthan, Mohammad Izani Ashari and Ahmad Zulqarnain Che Onn. Foo Shiou Voon is an alternative director for Mohammad Izani.Tan, Lau, Mohamadon and Mohammad Izani have been on the board since August 2015. Tan, Lau and Mohamadon were also directors at the old MAS.An accountant by training, Tan is currently non-executive deputy chairman of IJM Corp Bhd. Zamzamzairani served as the group CEO and managing director of Telekom Malaysia Bhd from April 2008 to April 2017, while Lau has over 35 years of experience in finance and is also a director of Axiata Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd. Mohamadon had served MAS for 32 years before retiring on Dec 31, 2004, as senior general manager of corporate services.Meanwhile, four board members — Sheranjiv, Mohammad Izani, Ahmad Zulqarnain and Foo — are Khazanah appointees. Asset sales may offer some reliefHLIB Research’s Wong believes it will be wise for the government to divest Malaysia Airlines or find a strategic partner instead of shutting it down, which will stem the draining of government cash while reducing staff layoff, as the takeover entity will still need a workforce to run the airline.Malaysia Airlines has undergone two rounds of layoffs in the last 13 years. It shed over 6,000 employees in 2006 and 2007 under the Business Turnaround Plan 1 and another 6,000 in 2015 under the MRP. Today. it has a 13,000-strong workforce, which some still consider bloated given its smaller network.A former Malaysia Airlines senior executive says the government should take a leaf from the sale of a 49.9% stake in national carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd to Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.“There won’t be any government interference in the management of the business then.“The entire board and key personnel of Malaysia Airlines must also be replaced. They had the opportunity to revive the airline, but failed. Let others in the private sector (preferably Malaysian) to fix this. It can be done,” he says.“The problems in Malaysia Airlines are obvious; we need the ‘will’ to do it. The government needs to let go of the national airline and let the private sector run it entirely, just like BA and Iberia,” he adds.He is also of the view that Malaysia Airlines’ business units like cargo, engineering, flight catering, ground handling and the loyalty programme should be transformed from cost centres to profit centres where they are responsible for their own revenues, costs and resulting profits.“These units should be looked at as standalone businesses. They  can then grow and expand without being held back by the passenger business.”Malaysia Airlines’ FY2017 financial statements show that its cargo revenue stood at just RM551.27 million, a far cry from the RM1.66 billion reported in FY2013.Its engineering services business has also been scaled down from a world-renowned player in the maintenance, repair and overhaul market under MAS Aerospace Engineering to a purely self-supporting unit today. Airport handling and engineering services revenue stood at RM49.34 million in FY2017 compared with RM256.86 million in FY2013. Note:Following the publication of this story, UEM Edgenta Bhd has clarified that Malaysia Airlines Bhd had conducted an open tender process for the RM42.99 million three-year facility management services contract covering specific parts of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and its Kelana Jaya academy in Petaling Jaya, and not via direct negotiation as reported.The open tender process saw the participation of several facility management service providers including KFM Holdings Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of UEM Edgenta, UEM Edgenta said in a statement.It noted that Malaysia Airlines undertook a request for information in May 2015, followed by a request for proposal in July 2015 and commercial clarification.""In the final round, KFM along with two other facilities management service providers were shortlisted. KFM was informed of the contract award in February 2016 and it was completed in December 2018,"" it said.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/special-report-saving-malaysia-airlines-again

"March 26, 2019 17:00 pm +08",TM,"Green Packet, MYTV in contract dispute ","MYTV Broadcasting Sdn Bhd is embroiled in yet another dispute, this time with Green Packet Bhd for non-payment of 200,000 set-top boxes (STBs) and non-fulfilment of obligations under a contract signed in January last year.Last November, the broadcast service provider got into a dispute with Telekom Malaysia Bhd for failing to pay RM60 million for services rendered. As a result, MYTV saw its broadcasting services in several states suspended.On Feb 4, Green Packet issued a notice of arbitration to MYTV, seeking payment for the first batch of 200,000 STBs that were supplied to the latter, as well as for the company to take up the supply and delivery of the remaining 1.4 million STBs.Not many are aware of the dispute between the two companies as the announcement was somewhat hidden within Green Packet’s Feb 26 quarterly results announcement, under “material events subsequent to the end of the quarter”.Few details of the arbitration case were provided as the company did not make any separate announcement on material litigation.Green Packet merely said the notice of arbitration was issued pursuant to “Clause 42 of the agreement” dated Jan 23 last year, for the design, supply, assembly, testing and acceptance of DVB-T2 (T2000) STBs.Under the contract, purchase orders may be issued by MYTV to the contractor from time to time for the supply of up to 3.6 million STBs, provided that no further purchase orders will be issued after the expiry of two years.On Jan 23 last year, Green Packet announced that it had clinched a RM272 million contract to supply 3.6 million STBs to MYTV, a company that is controlled by tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Albukhary, which was awarded a concession by the government to operate the infrastructure and network facilities for digital terrestrial TV services.The orders were expected to help loss-making Green Packet — a communications and technology services firm founded by technopreneur Puan Chan Cheong in 2000 — to return to the black in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018).However, Green Packet’s turnaround plan seems to have hit a snag due to the contract dispute.“This contract was supposed to be a significant revenue contributor to Green Packet. But now, it seems like there will be no positive financial impact on the group until the dispute is resolved,” a senior media analyst tells The Edge.For perspective, purchase orders for 1.6 million STBs will be directly issued by MYTV, while the remaining two million STBs will be from the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) in the form of back-to-back orders.Recall that MYTV was awarded the licence under the National Broadcasting Digitalisation Project to develop and manage the infrastructure and network facilities for digital terrestrial TV (DTT) services in Malaysia, in a move to migrate the country’s terrestrial broadcasting from analogue to digital. What went wrong?According to industry sources, MYTV appears to be running into financial difficulties, but the DTT project will proceed as the company is likely to source the STBs from other vendors.“Syed Mokhtar claimed that he had invested close to RM500 million (in MYTV), mainly to build the network and infrastructure, but the company somehow does not have enough money to execute the DTT project,” a source tells The Edge.The senior media analyst says MYTV is stuck in its current predicament because it is not investing enough in its business. “At one time, it was trying to get some vendors to finance the company,” the analyst adds.Although Green Packet stepped in to help MYTV to fast track the DTT project in January last year, the broadcasting firm is said to be facing some financial difficulties, and orders and payments were delayed.When contacted by The Edge, both Green Packet and MYTV declined to comment on the dispute. Court documents, meanwhile, are not publicly available as arbitration to resolve disputes is held behind closed doors.A check on the MYTV website shows that the company has commenced distribution of free decoder sets to Bantuan Sara Hidup Rakyat recipients nationwide until the end of this month.MYTV is responsible for developing a digital multimedia broadcasting hub and a network of high, medium and low-powered digital TV transmitters. The initiative is under the purview of the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia and monitored by MCMC.Overall, MYTV will be installing 60 main transmitters and 40 gap fillers to provide signal coverage to 98% of the population.Analogue switch-off (ASO) is the process by which older analogue TV broadcasting technology is converted to and replaced by digital TV.Switching to digital TV is necessary as the world migrates from analogue to digital broadcasting. Going digital will allow the government to free up frequency spectrum that can be used for higher quality and efficient mobile services.With DTT, a lower cost of capital expenditure can be expected as there is no need to lay hybrid fibre coaxial cables, rent additional transponders or launch new satellites. With the reduction of infrastructure costs, broadcasters will be able to concentrate their financial resources on producing content.Asean member countries have been collectively aiming for ASO in phases between 2015 and 2020. To ensure signal harmonisation, countries with interconnected borders, including Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei, have agreed to a 2018 ASO target.It is part of the national agenda to transform the country’s broadcasting industry through digitisation with the aim of improving living standards as the country gears up for developed nation status by next year. It is also one of the key initiatives in the 11th Malaysia Plan. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/green-packet-mytv-contract-dispute

The more appropriate measure of its performance, however, and the more telling one, is the 21.6% drop in the net worth adjusted (NWA) of the portfolio from RM116 billion in 2017 to RM91 billion in 2018.A more detailed look shows that the value of Khazanah’s holdings in its two telcos alone, Axiata Group Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), lost RM8.5 billion in market capitalisation, while the drop in the share prices of Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (CIMB) and IHH Healthcare Bhd (IHH) contributed to the contraction of the NWA. Clearly, market sentiment towards these major Khazanah investee companies turned negative, resulting in the drop of their share prices. The share price of TM opened 2018 at above RM6 and closed the year at RM2.65, hitting a low of RM2.15 along the way. The FBM KLCI, by contrast, contracted only 3% in 2018.The explanation for the contraction of the NWA is a rather straightforward one. While overall market sentiments softened in 2018, the FBM KLCI still outperformed both the MSCI Global and Emerging Market indices. The 21.6% drop in Khazanah’s NWA is, therefore, peculiar to its holdings in selected companies — TM, Axiata, TNB, CIMB, IHH and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB). There were policy and regulatory changes in 2018 that affected these particular companies and, therefore, market sentiments towards them. Herein lies a larger issue.These same companies, all of them public companies, have other investors, institutional and retail, domestic and foreign. These investors too suffered the same losses as Khazanah. Major domestic institutional investors such as the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) and Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KWAP) must have invested in these historically well-performing companies and they, too, will have suffered similar losses in value, which will affect both their portfolio values as well as the dividends they pay out to their respective subscribers.Beyond these domestic institutional investors, there are also foreign funds that invest in good performing Malaysian companies. They, too, will have invested in these same companies and they would have suffered the same losses. While some domestic institutional investors are constrained from investing in domestic markets, foreign investors are free to move to where the risk-weighted returns are the best. Some of them have exited our market, with net foreign fund outflow for 2018 totalling RM11.6 billion.What has happened is that policy and regulatory changes adversely affected market sentiments — not just for the specific companies but, more alarmingly, for the Malaysian market more generally. These sporadic bouts of policy changes would have been tolerated by investors if they were part of a broader policy shift that is well communicated and understood, but that is not the case.In the case of the telcos, policy and regulatory changes — on what should have been commercial decisions such as product design and pricing — seriously affected earnings forecasts and, therefore, investors’ valuations of the companies. The drop in share prices simply reflect that outlook. This is the kind of regulatory risks that investors are fearful of. They are capable of assessing companies’ operational efficiency as well as locating them properly within the industry landscape but it is regulatory risks that present a challenge and thus constitutes the larger bulk of risk.Changes in regulatory regimes that are seen as reacting to specific impetus without a broader coherence will just increase the risk profile of Malaysia as a whole. The Malaysian economy can ill-afford the increased risk profile. Our current account surplus has dwindled over the years, closing 2018 at barely 3% of gross domestic product, and it is not expected to improve given sluggish trade sentiments, while the need to borrow and refinance debts will continue. Portfolio outflows make things worse. Therefore, maintaining investors’ confidence and managing the country’s risk profile is of utmost importance.What is still missing at the policy level today is a big picture economic story — phrased positively in terms of what it is rather than what it is not. That will set a direction, a focal point for all other subsidiary stories. It will also identify the lynchpins of the story — the key economic imperatives that drive the whole story, among which, I reckon, is to protect investors’ confidence.Matters of policy relate to the boundary between the state and markets. What is the role of the government in the economy? From the perspective of the capital market, terms like government-linked companies (GLCs) should be properly used or its usage abandoned altogether. Policy and regulations cannot discriminate between GLCs and non-GLCs if a company, a public company, is deemed a GLC merely because statutory funds whose monies do not belong to the government, such as the EPF, PNB and Social Security Organisation (Socso) have shares in it. Are Sime Darby, Malayan Banking Bhd, CIMB, Axiata and IJM Corp Bhd government-related companies?In the case of sectors where there used to be natural monopolies, such as utilities and airports, privatised public enterprises such as TNB, TM and Malaysia Airports may still have government holdings in the form of Khazanah shares in them, but these are publicly listed companies with sizeable private and even international investors, and they should neither be favoured nor made victims of policy or regulations.These are commercial entities and should be treated as such — treated by how they behave in the marketplace rather than according to their lineage or even the composition of their shareholders. Commercial disputes between companies, for example, should be matters resolved by the rule of law without the parentage of companies being taken into consideration, what more direct government intervention.The whole point of the Putrajaya Committee for GLC High Performance programme launched in 2004 was to improve the performance of the 20 publicly listed companies that had either significant holdings by statutory funds or a governmental legacy so that they are subjected to market discipline and their governance be made equally transparent.When the 10-year programme ended in 2015, the total shareholder return of these 20 companies grew at 11.1% annually and their aggregate market capitalisation increased from RM133.8 billion to RM386 billion — almost a three times multiple.Beyond that, the regulatory environment was improved mainly by clearly demarcating policy, which can get enmeshed with the political imperative of the government and regulation, which should be driven by promoting healthy competition to attract investors into industries. Empowering shareholders and the presence of regulators, independent of policymakers, create a rules-based environment, the kind of environment investors prefer.The problematic part of government’s presence in the economy are the numerous companies established by the various statutory bodies. There has been a proliferation of these companies. These are not government-linked companies, but outright government-owned, effectively state-owned enterprises (SOEs). They should be properly labelled and need some sort of rationalisation, and a major part of public sector reform should be a serious re-examination of the government’s use of non-governmental organisations — companies established under the Companies Act — as policy tools.The government has been using companies as policy tools in the form of SOEs to achieve bumiputera participation objectives but this approach has not worked. Compare this to the much better performance of funds such as PNB using the capital markets to invest and therefore support performing firms, but the firms they invest in should be treated neutrally by the regulations.These are not GLCs, certainly not SOEs, but public companies with a wide spectrum of investors whose collective performance defines the health of the country’s economy. Truth be told, PNB operating in the capital market has been more successful in achieving the bumiputera agenda objectives than most other policy tools.Clarity in these fundamental issues will create the right environment and the right incentives for investors to decide which enterprises to support and what, in their view, are potentially profitable ones. The government should have a facilitative and not a participative role. It should focus on providing policy clarity and regulatory certainty to attract investments. In order to obtain such an outcome, the government must first articulate a big picture story that sets a strategic direction understood by all interested parties.Nungsari A Radhi is an economist.

MFL claims that TM had breached the term sheet on Jan 29, 2018 before its expiry on Oct 31, 2018.MFL is also seeking a declaration from TM that MFL had lawfully terminated the term sheet in MFL’s March 2019 notice of termination, together with an order for TM to remove all references as a sponsor and broadcast partner.MFL announced last week that it is ending the sponsorship contract with TM worth RM480 million after reaching a unanimous decision at a board meeting in Johor Baru.TM responded that it is no longer MFL’s sponsor from 2019 onwards, but denied MFL’s claim that it had failed to meet its obligations in the contract between the two parties. TM has instructed its solicitors to take necessary steps to defend MFL’s claim.TM’s Unifi brand was signed in February last year as the title sponsor for the Super League and Malaysia Cup for an eight-year partnership deal worth RM480 million until 2025.TM has not made any provisions for this claim and we expect it to be categorised under contingent liability as this could be a protracted legal case.

"March 22, 2019 18:07 pm +08",TM,"Why does Malaysia Airlines keep failing — and is there a way to stop it?","SHOULD the government choose to shut it down, Malaysia Airlines Bhd will go down as the first national airline in Asia to go bust (Japan Airlines emerged from bankruptcy after two years), joining the ranks of its European counterparts such as Sabena, Air Berlin, Alitalia and Cyprus Airways.The flag carrier, which saw Khazanah Nasional Bhd pay RM1.38 billion to take it private in August 2014 and reboot it into a smaller airline under its current name in September 2015, is once again facing an uncertain future after Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad remarked last week that shutting it down was one option being considered by the government. Selling the national asset and refinancing its debts are two other possibilities the government will explore, he said.The prime minister’s warning comes as calls for the beleaguered airline to be wound down intensified in the past few weeks. The airline’s woes flared up on March 5 after its sole shareholder Khazanah reported its first annual loss in over a decade, mainly due to a RM3.7 billion writedown of Malaysia Airlines’ value last year.It doesn’t help matters that the airline missed its target to return to the black last year and, according to Centre for Aviation (CAPA) chief analyst and chief representative for Southeast Asia Brendan Sobie, will find it difficult to achieve profitability, at least in the near future, given current market conditions.On March 1, the private company revealed that it finished 2018 with a marginally lower loss compared to a year ago but it did not disclose the figures.Filings with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) show that Malaysia Airlines’ net loss increased by 85% year on year to RM812.11 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY2017). It has lost RM2.35 billion between 2015 and 2017.While it did not disclose its exact revenue for FY2018 except to say that it grew by 1% y-o-y, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that revenue rose to RM8.76 billion from RM8.67 billion in FY2017. It has yet to file its financial statements for FY2018 with SSM.Malaysia Airlines blamed FY2018’s poor performance on crew shortage, intense competition, oversupply of capacity and volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange.It is worth noting that when the 12-point MAS Recovery Plan (MRP) was conceived in 2014, fuel price was US$75.68 per barrel. As at March 8, 2019, the International Air Transport Association jet fuel price monitor was up 3.5% at US$80.30 per barrel from a year ago.The ringgit had also weakened by 3.6% to 4.9% to 4.0910 against the US dollar last Thursday. Khazanah’s assumption under the five-year recovery plan was that the local currency would range from 3.90 to 3.95.Still, critics point to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, which turned things around with a HK$2.3 billion profit last year after three years of heavy losses and Singapore Airlines (SIA), which managed to turn in a net profit of S$284 million for the third financial quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, amid the challenging operating environment. Khazanah seen more willing to give up the flag carrierAfter not one but four failed attempts at restructuring the national carrier and setting it on a path to sustainable profitability, including during the 42 years when it was known as Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), the calls are growing louder for the government to shut it down for good.Its weak financial health — even after a RM6 billion injection from Khazanah in 2014 — also makes it a prime target when Malaysia’s new government is looking to trim its huge debt of RM1.087 trillion as at Dec 31, 2018.Indeed, some analysts say the timing of Khazanah’s RM3.7 billion impairment charge on Malaysia Airlines in 2018 is an indication that it may be ready to end or sell its loss-making unit.HLIB Research aviation analyst Daniel Wong notes that Malaysia Airlines is not part of Khazanah’s core portfolio, suggesting that the state investment firm would be willing to part with its airline business if the investment does not make financial sense and assuming government approval is granted.“While we do not doubt Malaysia Airlines is a pride to Malaysia as the national carrier has been around since 1947, we remain doubtful of Khazanah’s willingness and ability to sustain the continued losses of Malaysia Airlines. The losses of Malaysia Airlines may amount to RM1 billion per year,” he says in a March 13 report. Malaysia Airlines can still fly highOnce-troubled flag carriers such as British Airways (BA), Japan Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Qantas Airways are living proof that Malaysia Airlines still has a chance of turning around, says a senior aviation consultant who declined to be named.A multitude of factors have contributed to Malaysia Airlines’ financial woes, but foremost among them is the lack of autonomy to run the business without government intervention, say airline experts and analysts.“There are no obvious or easy solutions and there are so many external factors that will impact Malaysia Airlines’ future financials. However, there are areas for potential improvement,” CAPA’s Sobie tells The Edge.“While the latest restructuring went much deeper than previous attempts, it didn’t go deep enough and address all the legacy issues. The airline could potentially take another crack at reducing its costs but this can only be effective if there is no political interference.“It could also relook its commercial and network strategy. Evolving into more of a regional airline could be an option,” he says.Sobie points out that while shutting down the airline is obviously politically difficult and has never really been an option, it now seems that it is being seriously considered.“There would still be sufficient competition in the market (even with Malaysia Airlines gone) and the void would likely be filled by the existing or new competitors. Keep in mind there were only two (Malaysia-based) players (Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia Group Bhd) before Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd was launched five years ago. However, another restructuring would still likely be the preferred option politically,” he adds.Transport infrastructure consultancy Modalis Infrastructure Partners associate director Khair Mirza believes Malaysia Airlines can thrive given a level playing field.“By definition, GLCs (government-linked companies) need to play a dual role. So, as long as it has a level playing field against other carriers, it can succeed, like how Qantas, Turkish Airlines and Garuda have all succeeded,” he adds.Khair points out that Malaysia Airlines is the only recognised strategic GLC that faces unfettered competition while trying to balance a social equity role. “It’s like asking an elephant to climb up a coconut tree just because the monkey has glorified climbing trees.”Meanwhile, a senior aviation consultant notes that the government must also ensure that Malaysia Airlines has the right people on its board of directors to steer the airline.“The board has had many of the same members for several years despite losses. It is good to have new people with fresh ideas to help move Malaysia Airlines forward.“It is also good to have a combination of some with overall airline industry experience (at least two to three years) and some good professionals in finance and law,” he adds.The consultant also points out that the airline must have the right people in senior management. “Malaysia Airlines CEO Izham Ismail should be given a chance to carry on and he deserves the freedom to name his own team,” he says.Modalis’ Khair concurs, noting that a shake-up of the eight-member board is long overdue.He also believes that it is time to allow Malaysia Airlines to award contracts based on competitive bidding rather than “giving contracts to non-strategic investees that have bloated into public-listed entities, squeezing out bona fide market participants”. A case in point is the RM42.99 million three-year contract bagged by UEM Edgenta Bhd’s 80%-owned subsidiary KFM Holdings Bhd in June 2016 to provide facility management services to Malaysia Airlines via direct negotiation.A check on Malaysia Airlines website reveals that its board comprises one executive director —  Izham — and seven non-executive directors, namely Tan Sri Krishnan Tan Boon Seng, Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, David Lau Nai Pek, Dr Mohamadon Abdullah, Sheranjiv M Sammanthan, Mohammad Izani Ashari and Ahmad Zulqarnain Che Onn. Foo Shiou Voon is an alternative director for Mohammad Izani.Tan, Lau, Mohamadon and Mohammad Izani have been on the board since August 2015. Tan, Lau and Mohamadon were also directors at the old MAS.An accountant by training, Tan is currently non-executive deputy chairman of IJM Corp Bhd. Zamzamzairani served as the group CEO and managing director of Telekom Malaysia Bhd from April 2008 to April 2017, while Lau has over 35 years of experience in finance and is also a director of Axiata Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd. Mohamadon had served MAS for 32 years before retiring on Dec 31, 2004, as senior general manager of corporate services.Meanwhile, four board members — Sheranjiv, Mohammad Izani, Ahmad Zulqarnain and Foo — are Khazanah appointees. Asset sales may offer some reliefHLIB Research’s Wong believes it will be wise for the government to divest Malaysia Airlines or find a strategic partner instead of shutting it down, which will stem the draining of government cash while reducing staff layoff, as the takeover entity will still need a workforce to run the airline.Malaysia Airlines has undergone two rounds of layoffs in the last 13 years. It shed over 6,000 employees in 2006 and 2007 under the Business Turnaround Plan 1 and another 6,000 in 2015 under the MRP. Today. it has a 13,000-strong workforce, which some still consider bloated given its smaller network.A former Malaysia Airlines senior executive says the government should take a leaf from the sale of a 49.9% stake in national carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd to Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.“There won’t be any government interference in the management of the business then.“The entire board and key personnel of Malaysia Airlines must also be replaced. They had the opportunity to revive the airline, but failed. Let others in the private sector (preferably Malaysian) to fix this. It can be done,” he says.“The problems in Malaysia Airlines are obvious; we need the ‘will’ to do it. The government needs to let go of the national airline and let the private sector run it entirely, just like BA and Iberia,” he adds.He is also of the view that Malaysia Airlines’ business units like cargo, engineering, flight catering, ground handling and the loyalty programme should be transformed from cost centres to profit centres where they are responsible for their own revenues, costs and resulting profits.“These units should be looked at as standalone businesses. They  can then grow and expand without being held back by the passenger business.”Malaysia Airlines’ FY2017 financial statements show that its cargo revenue stood at just RM551.27 million, a far cry from the RM1.66 billion reported in FY2013.Its engineering services business has also been scaled down from a world-renowned player in the maintenance, repair and overhaul market under MAS Aerospace Engineering to a purely self-supporting unit today. Airport handling and engineering services revenue stood at RM49.34 million in FY2017 compared with RM256.86 million in FY2013. Note:Following the publication of this story, UEM Edgenta Bhd has clarified that Malaysia Airlines Bhd had conducted an open tender process for the RM42.99 million three-year facility management services contract covering specific parts of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and its Kelana Jaya academy in Petaling Jaya, and not via direct negotiation as reported.The open tender process saw the participation of several facility management service providers including KFM Holdings Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of UEM Edgenta, UEM Edgenta said in a statement.It noted that Malaysia Airlines undertook a request for information in May 2015, followed by a request for proposal in July 2015 and commercial clarification.""In the final round, KFM along with two other facilities management service providers were shortlisted. KFM was informed of the contract award in February 2016 and it was completed in December 2018,"" it said.For related story, see: Overcapacity sends Malaysia Airlines further into turbulence",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/why-does-malaysia-airlines-keep-failing-%E2%80%94-and-there-way-stop-it

The power plant has a total capacity of 1,440 mW, comprising four generating units of 360 mW each.Mudajaya’s venture into the Indian power production industry goes as far back as in 2009, when it took up a 26% stake in RKM Powergen Pvt Ltd to undertake the construction of the power plant, with an estimated investment of RM5 billion.More than a year ago, it reduced its stake in the Indian independent power producer to 18.93% through disposing of its 7.07% stake in RKM to Apollo Ventures Co Ltd for US$19.5 million.Progressive Impact Corp Bhd has bagged a 109.22 billion rupiah (RM31.35 million) contract from Chevron Corp to undertake environmental sampling and laboratory analysis for its Sumatera operation in Indonesia.It said the award is a continuity of the existing business that its subsidiary PT ALS Indonesia has with Chevron. Additionally, the contract serves as a business expansion in a foreign market, that is, Indonesia, it added.Perdana Petroleum Bhd has secured a RM17.7 million contract from Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd to supply two units of accommodation work barges.It said the first work barges will be chartered for a period of 120 days with an extension option. The contract will begin on March 29.For the second work barges, it said will be chartered for 200 days with an option for a period of 15 + 15 days. The contract is effective from April 1.MCE Holdings Bhd has secured two contracts to supply various electronic and mechatronic components and parts for Proton and Perodua new car models.The Proton contract will generate total revenue of RM35 million over the nine-year period, while the estimated total investment cost to be incurred will be RM3.8 million.The Perodua project is expected to generate total revenue of RM16 million for MCE over the four-year period, while the estimated total investment cost is RM130,000.Proton, a 50.1%-owned by DRB-Hicom Bhd will collaborate with a local partner to establish a manufacturing assembly plant in Pakistan, its first in the South Asia region.The agreement was inked by Proton and its local partner, Alhaj Automotive last year.“This is significant because it will be Proton’s first (assembly) plant in South Asia and the population of Pakistan is 210 million,” said Malaysia High Commissioner to Pakistan Ikram Mohammad Ibrahim.Vizione Holdings Bhd said Wira Syukur (M) Sdn Bhd, a construction firm injected into Vizione for RM280 million — reported a profit after tax of RM57.33 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18) — has exceeded its profit guarantee by RM3.31 million.This brings Wira Syukur’s two-year net profit for FY17 and FY18 to RM85.91 million, exceeding the guarantee amount of at least RM82.59 million, it added.Plantation group United Malacca Bhd saw its net profit slide to RM2.36 million for the third quarter ended January 31, 2019 from RM10.29 million in the previous corresponding quarter, due to its adoption of the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards framework and lower average prices of crude palm oil and palm kernel.Excluding the impact of MFRS adoption, its pre-tax profit would be RM9.88 million, compared with RM3.3 million.Quarterly revenue fell 17% to RM53.48 million from RM64.44 million a year earlier. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tm-mudajaya-progressive-impact-perdana-petroleum-dayang-enterprise-mce-drbhicom-vizione-and

(March 19, RM3.18)
Upgrade to market perform with a higher target price of RM3.10: Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) has revealed its intention to sell more buildings and land bank to unlock the value of its assets following a tender bid called for its two buildings (Annexe 1 and Annexe 2) recently, according to the local media. The intention to rationalise its non-core property assets came as no surprise to us given TM is consistently aiming to create long-term value for its shareholders via strengthening the balance sheet and focus the company’s portfolio on its core business that drives growth. 
TM has published a tender notice recently for the 20-storey TM Annexe 1 and the 33-storey Annexe 2, which are located next to Menara TM, and plans to close the submission on March 29. The two leasehold office towers have a combined gross floor area of 679,015 sq ft with a net lettable area of 468,772 sq ft. It has lately been reported that the reserve price range is between RM273 million and RM312 million, implying RM755-RM1,027 per sq ft, similar to the surrounding price offered based on our observation. While the net book value (NBV) of the said buildings is unknown for now, we understand that all its buildings and land as per its 2017 annual report were estimated to be RM3 billion, of which 30% (or RM877 million) was derived from value of land and 55% (or RM1.17 billion) from its buildings located in Kuala Lumpur.The disposal of two office blocks is expected to generate extra cash to TM, which could be utilised for capital expenditure or lowering debts. For illustration purposes, assuming the two office blocks are disposed of at their reserve price (RM585 million), coupled with half of its land unloaded at 20% higher than its 2017 NBV, TM’s balance sheet could potentially be strengthened by an additional RM1.1 billion in cash. Should all of the proceeds be utilised for lowering debts, financial year 2019 (FY19) gross debt/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ratio could be reduced to 2.2 times (compared with 2.5 times initially) with gearing of 0.6 times (compared with 0.8 times). However, we downplay the prospect of special dividend (arising from the proposed disposals) given the group is aiming to strengthen its cash position amid rising cost pressure and competition.While we make no changes to our FY19-FY20 estimated earnings for now, pending the outcome of the tender process, we believe TM is on the right track to enhance operational efficiency and strengthen its balance sheet via active asset management. — Kenanga Research, March 19",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tms-active-asset-management-move-seen-positive-step
"March 20, 2019 09:48 am +08",TM,"Listing unlisted GLCs will improve operations — fund managers","KUALA LUMPUR: The government’s plan to list some of its matured unlisted entities is a good move albeit not a surprising one, which could drive these government-linked companies (GLCs) to operate more efficiently once they are put under public scrutiny, said fund managers.Moody’s Investors Service analyst Anushka Shah said the divestment of GLCs is not a new initiative, pointing out that it was the cornerstone of the 10-year GLC Transformation Programme which was concluded in 2015.“Listing GLCs may bring some benefits in terms of greater transparency and disclosure standards, achieving a greater balance between the public and private sectors, and better governance,” she told The Edge Financial Daily.Anushka, however, pointed out that asset divestments generally lack predictability.Speaking at the two-day Invest Malaysia conference yesterday, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia’s matured unlisted government entities may be listed on the stock market, with the government also looking into some of its shareholdings in GLCs, indicating that it may cut its stakes in certain listed companies.He said this is to ensure greater risk control parameters for issuances of government guarantees, better market access and identification of opportunities of potential asset monetisation, adding that GLCs will play “certain catalytic roles to support the economy”.MIDF Research head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman said corporatising GLCs could be a good move, seeing how Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) and Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s (TNB) operations had transformed from their previous incarnations as Jabatan Telekom and Lembaga Letrik Negara respectively.“Looking at TM and TNB, from just being government departments previously, they have grown leaps and bounds in playing an active role in the development of the telecommunications and power sectors.“They [currently] finance their own capex (capital expenditure) needs without burdening the government’s coffers while providing opportunities to many entrepreneurs to join as vendors and resellers,” he said.In terms of potential candidates that could see a listing, Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng said there are many companies that could be candidates, based on the high number of companies under government-linked investment companies such as Khazanah Nasional Bhd and Permodalan Nasional Bhd.He added that units of Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) could also be potential candidates.However, Ang said, the GLCs that the government intends to list must be companies that investors are interested in, in order to get good value.“It must be something that investors want. If it is just listings for the sake of listings, the government will not get good valuation as people will not be interested to invest. The government has to see where the demand is in the market and then look at which companies it can list and sell at a good price,” he said.Astramina Advisory Sdn Bhd managing director Wong Muh Rong concurred that Petronas is a likely candidate, given that it is a world-class company with reputable governance, comparing it to Saudi Arabia’s national oil and gas company Saudi Aramco which is also planning an initial public offering in 2021.“The government does not need to let go of a substantial portion of its shareholdings as they can already raise a lot of funds just by monetising a 20% to 30% stake in Petronas.“Petronas is a good candidate. It is not difficult to sell and the government can get fairly good upfront money and use it to boost market activity,” said Wong.On the other hand, another fund manager, who declined to be named, said it is unlikely that an offer for Petronas would be on the table but noted that the government could start divesting its holdings in some of the relatively smaller companies first.“I don’t think the government will list Petronas as it is considered a strategic asset. They can still monetise [it] but maybe just a minority stake or a division under the group,” said the fund manager.He pointed to Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera’s portfolio which includes Affin Bank Bhd and Boustead Holdings Bhd, and said that the government could test the water with the sale of smaller stakes to see how the market reacts before touching the bigger investments.Socio-Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie said the investments that could potentially be disposed of depend on the government’s definition of “matured assets”.“Based on Khazanah’s new mandate, it seems to be referring to businesses that can already stand on their own feet, with decent price-to-book that no longer needs institutional funds as anchor investors.“The companies that come to mind in terms of monetisation could be CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, TM and other companies in the utility and aviation sectors,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/listing-unlisted-glcs-will-improve-operations-%E2%80%94-fund-managers
"March 19, 2019 10:08 am +08",TM,"TM’s sale of non-core assets a welcome move, say analysts","KUALA LUMPUR: Telekom Malaysia Bhd’s (TM) decision to sell its non-core assets sits well with analysts, who view any positive cash flow for the group as a welcomed development.One analyst said the move was timely, as the cash generated from the sale can be used to finance business activities, in lieu of the group approaching external creditors and developing a higher gearing ratio.“Any business would want to do that; it is something that should have been done in the first place,” said the analyst who did not wish to be named.He added that the sale of such assets should not come as a surprise to investors as the group has been consistent in its desire to optimise its assets to ensure optimal profitability.TM recently said that at the end of the fourth quarter of financial year 2018 (4QFY18) ended Dec 31, 2018, the group had RM8.57 billion in borrowings, of which 18% or RM1.54 billion was US dollar-denominated.According to Bloomberg data, the group has a debt-to-equity ratio of 79.67.The group’s 4QFY18 net profit slumped 78% to RM69.66 million, from RM277.01 million a year earlier. Quarterly revenue fell 3.5% to RM3.09 billion from RM3.2 billion previously.For FY18 as a whole, the group’s net profit declined 83.5% to RM153.15 million, from RM929.75 million for FY17, with revenue slipping 2.2% to RM11.82 billion from RM12.09 billion.Another analyst said while the move to sell non-core assets was part of TM’s playbook to improve its balance sheet, it could also signal the group’s intention to be an “asset-light entity” as it shifts its focus to digitalisation.Asked if he expects an escalation in the number of asset sales in the near future, the analyst said he does not as TM has been consistent in its desire to unlock the value of its non-core assets as part of its strategy.“They (TM) have a lot of legacy assets such as exchanges, with some of these exchanges being converted into IT (information technology) exchanges. There is a need to relook at the entire portfolio of assets that they have,” he said.The analyst explained that the group has a lot of infrastructure that could be repurposed, with one example being the conversion of telephone switch exchanges into IT exchanges for the provision of the Internet.TM announced late last month that it would be selling its Annexe 1 and Annexe 2 buildings at its headquarters in Kuala Lumpur for between RM273.4 million and RM312 million, depending on whether the buildings are in a vacant state or with tenancy agreements upon purchase.TM acting group chief executive officer Imri Mokhtar has been reported as saying that the group is looking at transforming itself into a more agile organisation that can quickly take advantage of new opportunities.Imri said the group is looking at only selling such assets for what it deems as fetching a “good value”, with the proceeds from such disposals utilised by its core business activities and working capital requirements.Both analysts are of the belief that 2018 was a particularly bad year for TM and that the net impact of the government’s Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP) on high-speed broadband of the telco has yet to be fully realised, as a full year has to be given for a clearer view on its impact.They added that the group’s FY18 results were resultant of the group lowering its prices as per the MSAP and increased competition from others telcos, particularly with high-speed broadband.For the second analyst, TM has to deal with short-term challenges such as a reduction in its workforce as it transitions into a more digital company. TM has a 12-month target price of RM2.88, with three “buy” calls, 15 “hold” calls and nine “sell” calls on the stock.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tms-sale-noncore-assets-welcome-move-say-analysts

It accused TM of failing to meet its RM60 million annual sponsorship obligation before the M-League kicked off on Feb 1 despite several reminders.TM denied the charge, saying both sides were unable to mutually agree on several fundamental commercial terms necessary for the intended collaboration.Magni-Tech Industries Bhd’s third quarter net profit rose 14.4% to RM35.62 million from RM31.14 million a year earlier, mainly on lower operating expenses. Quarterly revenue eased 1.4% to RM309 million from RM313.3 million previously on lower sales order received from both the garment and packaging plastic segments.Magni-Tech declared a third interim dividend of eight sen per share, bringing total dividends for the first three quarters to 18 sen per share, from 15 sen in the previous corresponding period.For the nine-month period, net profit rose 13% to RM80.84 million from RM71.23 million the year before, mainly thanks to lower operating expenses and higher foreign exchange gains.

Construction was completed on July 31, 2007 and the project was set to begin operations on March 22, 2010.In an immediate response, YTL clarified that its involvement in the project had ended in 2009 and hence it should not be held responsible for the project’s failure.Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd, which has been granted a 90-day extension on its restraining order from the High Court, said today that the amount of debts that it needs to restructure is not known yet.Nevertheless, the oil & gas firm pointed out that its total borrowings (inclusive of its subsidiaries) were at RM335.6 million as at end-2018. Based on its balance sheet as at Dec 31, 2018, the company’s long-term liabilities was at RM172.02 million and trade payables were at RM139.69 million.Barakah’s filing was in response to an article in The Edge Weekly for the week of March 18-24, 2019, which quoted sources as saying that Barakah alongside its two main subsidiaries — PBJV Group Sdn Bhd and Kota Laksamana 101 Ltd — are seeking to restructure RM726.53 million in debt.Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (MHB) has been slapped with a RM125.1 million claim by Kebabangan Petroleum Operating Co Sdn Bhd (KPOC) for alleged breach of contract to supply valves.Noting that the financial impact of the arbitration initiated by KPOC on the group is dependent on the outcome, MHB said the expected loss arising from this claim is anticipated to be RM125.1 million or more.MHB said it will vigorously defend the claims made by KPOC and is presently exploring its options to pursue a counterclaim against KPOC.The mandatory take-over offer by Can-One International Sdn Bhd to acquire the rest of the shares in Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd it does not own has turned unconditional today.Can-One Bhd  said that with the valid acceptances Can-One International has received, the offeror and ultimate offeror now holds a more than 50% stake in Kian Joo.Scientex Bhd has garnered valid acceptance of 52.54% shareholding in Daibochi Bhd for its share swap deal.Daibochi said the share-swap offer will remain open for acceptance up till April 1.Last November, Scientex announced its intention to acquire a 42.41% stake in Daibochi from 14 shareholders for RM222.5 million or RM1.60 apiece via a share swap.

"March 18, 2019 17:05 pm +08",TM,"Analysts say TM's sale of non-core assets is necessary","KUALA LUMPUR (March 18): Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM)'s sale of non-core assets is necessary for the group's further growth in light of its strategy and financial performance over the last year, say analysts.TM recently announced that it was selling its Annexe 1 and Annexe 2 buildings at its headquarters for RM273.4 million or RM312 million, depending on whether the buyer is buying the building vacant or with tenancy agreements in place.An analyst who asked not to be named told theedgemarkets.com that the telecommunication company's sale of non-core assets was timely, as cash generated from the sale can be used to finance further business activities, instead of borrowing more and developing a higher gearing ratio.""They have always been saying they wanted to optimise their assets. Whatever assets they have, they want the assets to give the optimum profitability.""Any business would want to do that, it is something that should have been done in the first place,"" he said.At the end of the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, the group said it had borrowed RM8.57 billion, with 18% or RM1.54 billion denominated in US dollar.The analyst added the sale was something the group should be doing in light of 2018's diminished profit and revenue.TM saw a 78% decrease in net profit for its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 (4QFY18) to RM69.66 million, from RM277.01 million previously.Quarterly revenue also decreased, in this instance by 3.5% to RM3.09 billion, from RM3.2 billion in 4QFY17.For the full financial year, the group saw its net profit decline by 83.5% to RM153.15 million from RM929.75 million the previous year, with revenue dipping 2.2% year-on-year to RM11.82 billion from RM12.09 billion.In a similar vein, another analyst who wished to remain anonymous said the sale of non-core assets, while part of the group's move to improve its balance sheet, was also part of a drive towards being ""an asset-light entity"", as the telco seeks to further digitalise.""From the point of view of telcos moving into digitalisation, the intention is to move towards being an asset-light entity.""So you free yourself from assets and non-core investments so that you can focus on selling your products and services through a digital landscape,"" he said.The analyst added he does not forecast any more such sales occurring in the near term, as the group has been continuously working on the sale of non-core assets as part of its strategy.""They (TM) have a lot of legacy assets such as exchanges, with some of these exchanges being converted into IT exchanges.""There is a need to relook at the entire portfolio of assets that they have,"" he said.According to a media report today, the telco has a land bank of RM2.9 billion as per its 2017 annual report, with the land and buildings being distributed across Malaysia, as well as a property in Hong Kong.TM acting group chief executive officer Imri Mokhtar was reported to have said the group over the past few years has been looking at unlocking the value of its buildings as it continues to optimise its network, adding that it will only sell if the group gets ""good value"" for the assets in question.Both analysts said the group's FY18 results were resultant of the group lowering its prices as per the Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP), as well as increased competition from other telcos, particularly in the realm of high-speed broadband.The duo added the jury is still out on the full impact of MSAP, and that only later this year will both investors and the telco industry be able to grasp the pricing policy's full impact.""They are no longer the sole player now (in high-speed broadband), there are more people coming into the game (the high-speed broadband market), things are getting more competitive, they are not a monopoly anymore,"" said the first analyst.Meanwhile, the second analyst said that in the short term the group will have to deal with challenges such as a reduction in its workforce as it moves forward with its digitalisation agenda.""They need to address a couple of structural issues that they have. If you look at their cost base, they have close to 30,000 people as a workforce.

"March 18, 2019 17:00 pm +08",TM,"Who’s right about Khazanah’s 2018 (under)performance?","EVIDENTLY, billion-ringgit headline losses were too good an opportunity to gain political mileage to let slip, going by the heated social media exchanges between Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali and former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak last week.When it comes to reported numbers, Najib — who was chairman of Khazanah Nasional Bhd until May 31 last year — is not wrong in saying that the sovereign wealth fund’s RM6.271 billion pre-tax losses for 2018 were the first it has reported in over a decade.Yet, part of the reason for last year’s underperformance was Khazanah’s portfolio of assets, which was concentrated in a handful of companies it had long invested in. The concentration risk was partly why Khazanah needed to rebalance its portfolio to deliver on its new mandate of growing Malaysia’s long-term wealth.A strategic review of its investments resulted in a RM7.3 billion impairment provision for 2018.“Roughly half” of the RM7.3 billion impairment was due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd, which Khazanah nationalised in 2014 after paying RM1.4 billion for the remaining 30% stake it did not own.Had that sizeable impairment for the loss-making national carrier been deemed necessary in 2017, Khazanah’s total impairment that year would have been nearer to RM5.95 billion — more than double the RM2.3 billion it booked that year. An impairment of that size would have wiped out the fund’s RM2.896 billion pre-tax profits for 2017 and resulted in two straight years of losses, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. Kitchen-sinking?Khazanah does not expect any large impairments to take place this year, even as Malaysia Airlines goes through another round of strategic review to improve its performance.“Khazanah should be able to return to profit [in 2019], given the fact that the clean-up we did in 2018 has gone through the books,” managing director Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan said on March 5 when presenting the company’s annual review. He also provided more details on its dual-basket — strategic and commercial — investment fund structure, objectives and targets.The sovereign wealth fund will need at least five to seven years to rebalance its portfolio into one that can sustainably provide consistent supplementary income to the government, Shahril told The Edge in a recent interview. Apart from supporting the government’s developmental goals via its strategic investments, its commercial fund will be more diversified in terms of asset allocation, sector and geography.As it is, its portfolio concentration risk can also be seen from its so-called net worth adjusted (NWA) value where one-third of the RM25 billion or 21.6% year-on-year decline to RM91 billion as at end-2018 came from two companies — Axiata Group Bhd (-RM5 billion) and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (-RM3.5 billion).Other sizeable downward NWA adjustments were made for its holdings in Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-RM1.9 billion), IHH Healthcare Bhd (-RM1.9 billion), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-RM1.5 billion) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (-RM200 million). The six made up RM14 billion or 56% of Khazanah’s NWA decline. Domestic factors, dealsWhile global markets underperformed last year on the back of geopolitical tension and pessimism over growth in emerging markets, Khazanah’s portfolio performance was further hampered by domestic developments, including regulatory changes, subdued earnings outlook and market volatility.To be sure, the headline RM6.271 billion pre-tax losses for 2018 are sizeable.Still, the RM7.3 billion (non-cash) impairment does not affect Khazanah’s cash flow position and capacity to pay RM1.5 billion in dividend for 2018. The fund received RM2.8 billion in dividends and booked RM1.4 billion divestment gains last year, down from RM3.1 billion in dividends and RM2.8 billion divestment gains in 2017.Khazanah paid RM30 million in dividend in 2005 when it reported a RM831 million pre-tax loss. It paid RM100 million in dividend in 2008 when it reported a RM223 million net loss in 2018. For 2019, the guidance is for “RM1 billion to RM1.5 billion” in dividend.It is understood that Khazanah’s sale of a 16% stake in IHH to Mitsui & Co Ltd for RM8.42 billion, which is targeted to be completed by end-March, is still awaiting foreign regulatory approval. According to Shahril, the proceeds will be used to rebalance its portfolio to generate greater returns for the country.A separate 26% stake in IHH is up for sale at the right price, as long as it does not destroy the value of the remaining holdings in Khazanah’s commercial basket. Other assets in the basket include its holdings in CIMB, Axiata and Alibaba.com as well as private assets such as The Holstein Milk Co, Sun Life Malaysia, WeLab and Palantir.Meanwhile, assets in its strategic basket are Malaysia Airlines, Telekom Malaysia, Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia Airports and PLUS Malaysia Bhd. Developmental assets such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Themed Attractions Resorts & Hotels Sdn Bhd (TARH), Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and Medini Iskandar Malaysia Sdn Bhd are also in this basket where economic benefits to the country also count as returns.It remains to be seen if UK-listed Merlin Entertainments plc, which makes money from operating Le­goland Malaysia on behalf of TARH, would buy a stake in the asset from Khazanah — just like how Mitsui had increased its stake in IHH by buying more shares from Kha­zanah. Talk of the potential sale of Legoland or an IPO of Khazanah’s theme parks had been circulating for some years.While Shahril said Khazanah was “not in talks with anyone and there are no offers on the table” when asked about the sale of Le­goland, he did not dismiss the possibility. “Everything has a value at the end of the day and if a great valuation comes in, we will look and see whether the capital that can be returned to our books can be better deployed in other areas,” he said, noting that Legoland is already profitable.Apart from behaving more like a portfolio manager to derive greater returns on its commercial assets, Khazanah is also targeting better cost-efficiency by cutting its cost-to-realisable asset value (RAV) ratio from 50 basis points in 2018 to 30 to 35 basis points in 2023. Part of this could come as it vacates premium office space at the Petronas Twin Towers in favour of transit-oriented Mercu UEM in KL Sentral. Khazanah, which has a long-term lease for 11,500 sq ft at The Shard in London, also has offices in Istanbul, Beijing, Mumbai and San Francisco.“Some of our offices are quite vital to our operations, like China, for example … we need people on the ground to ensure those assets are managed well and are creating value for Khazanah as a whole. Some of the other offices, for instance in London, may be less important because we will be adopting a more market-driven approach … if there is a cost benefit to us by running the international offices in a different way, we will make those decisions as we go along,” Shahril said.If Khazanah succeeds in becoming a significant revenue contributor to the government, there will be more money to improve the people’s well-being and less pressure to raise taxes.

"March 18, 2019 07:00 am +08",TM,"Building trust is not just the CEO’s job","For businesses and corporates, trust is a powerful currency that is often attached to their management’s reputation, among other things.Hence the aftermath of the 14th general election (GE14) in May 2018, when Corporate Malaysia saw many abrupt changes at the helm of larger companies that, eventually, turned the spotlight on the affected businesses.Among the questions that arose were how should companies protect the trust they have amid unplanned leadership shifts, and how should they mitigate any impact on confidence such changes has had.The answer is to consider the long-term effect when it comes to trust, according to PwC Malaysia managing partner Sridharan Nair, or Sri as he is known.An organisation that has built up its reservoir of trust and embedded it as part of corporate values can stand the test of time regardless of leadership changes, Sri explains.“There is a saying that consistency is the true foundation of trust. So if you do not have that consistency in an organisation, then this raises doubts [among stakeholders].“So, a balance has to be struck — the person whose face is on the front is the leader, but it is the organisation which [provides support], so it is not just what the leader says but how the group behaves as well,” he adds.That said, the onus of building confidence — or renewing it, as the case may be — lies with a company’s management that is often seen as its face as well.And the leader needs the backing of the organisation to be successful in doing that, says Sri.“The tone at the top needs to be set, essentially, to say ‘we need to promote integrity at the highest levels all the way through the organisation’,” he tells The Edge.“However, it is not just about rolling out a plan or initiative; it is how you see it through, from the actions to the enforcement of it [throughout the organisation],” he adds.The growing spotlight on the role of leadership in trust is accorded consideration in the PwC Malaysia Building Trust Awards, which returns this year for the third time since its inaugural edition back in 2015.The biennial awards recognise companies that are making significant moves in building integrity through their communications and interactions with stakeholders.To recap, no submissions or nominations are accepted for the awards. Instead, only the top 50 Malaysian public-listed companies (PLCs) on Bursa Malaysia by market capitalisation are considered.The annual reports of these 50 companies are then benchmarked against the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework (refer to Methodology). This would be based on the latest available annual reports as of June 2018. Following this, a total of 20 companies are then shortlisted. For this year, the 20 finalists listed in alphabetical order are: AirAsia Group Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, BIMB Holdings Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Digi.com Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, KLCCP Stapled Group, Malayan Banking Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Maxis Bhd, MISC Bhd, Petronas, RHB Bank Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Sunway Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.PwC Malaysia assurance and people partner Pauline Ho says on top of the existing assessment methodology, an additional survey was introduced this year as part of three dimensions of measuring trust perception in collaboration with The Iclif Leadership and Governance Centre (Iclif).According to Ho, the extra survey looks at trust in leadership as the first dimension. The review is designed for an organisation’s employees to answer questions surrounding leadership and their confidence in their company’s leadership team.For the second dimension, PwC conducts an independent survey via a third party to comb through online sources of data for conversations about trust on the 20 shortlisted organisations in order to build a trust profile for each.“The third dimension is a public poll, which is open to the public until March 31, 2019, where we get anyone who is not working within the organisation to comment on whether these [companies] are building trust,” says Ho.“[Through this] we have these different perspectives so that we not only listen to what the companies say about themselves, but also what employees think about their leadership and what the third parties are saying, as well as the public opinion,” Ho concludes.The findings will then be deliberated on by an independent panel of four judges who will select the winners.Rounding up the 2019 Building Trust Awards panel of judges are Sir David Tweedie who is the chairman of the board of trustees of the International Valuation Standards Council and past chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board; Tan Sri Dr Jemilah Mahmood who is under secretary general, partnerships at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; Malek Ali, who is the founder of BFM 89.9; and Nadiah Wan, the group CEO of TMC Life Sciences Bhd and CEO of the Thomson Hospital, Kota Damansara.The results will be revealed at an awards ceremony to be held in Kuala Lumpur, which is scheduled to take place in the second half of the year.This year, PwC also engaged the growing start-up community to understand their perspective on trust. However, start-up organisations are not part of the awards, which are currently meant for PLCs only.From the engagement, it is clear that large corporates can draw important lessons from start-ups on how to protect trust, which is vital to any start-up’s long-term survival, says Sri.“If they (start-ups) cannot get that (trust management) right, they believe that they are not going to be able to survive as a business. And I think that is probably a lesson for larger corporates where as you get bigger, you may have other priorities such as expansion or other engagement with stakeholders and shareholders as opposed to which segment actually makes your business work, which is the consumers who buy your products or services,” says Sri.“So we have seen the larger corporates refocusing on consumers and customers over the years. Their focus is on consumers and making sure that they get their consumers to believe in their idea and to address and to be very responsive to those consumers’ comments as well,” he adds.Interestingly, many start-ups feel that it is easier to boost trust as a big business, Sri reflects. On the other hand, start-ups also believe they can build up their trust reservoir through technology much faster, he adds.“They also believe that in the start-up phase, they can connect with the consumers quicker and in a more authentic manner than much more established businesses.“And, for established businesses, when you go into something that is new, it is more difficult to build trust because you are seen as this sort of business and doing this sort of thing, [but] trying to venture into something new.”In any case, the growing trust awareness in the business ecosystem in Malaysia is positive given that the private sector is a key driver of the economy, Sri says.“At the end of the day, it is about having businesses, corporates and start-ups, having the dialogue and discussion about the importance of trust. Businesses have a big role to play, and if we are able to raise the bar on how important trust is, then we are heading in the right direction.”To participate in the online poll, please visit http://bit.ly/pwctrustpoll 2019. CEOs weigh in on trust...As a leader, how do you inspire a culture of trust in Maybank?
Trust is ultimately about aligning personal and collective interests of a group to a pre-agreed destination — relying on each individual to do his part, so that the outcome is greater than the sum of the parts. The challenge is to ensure agreement among members that group interests should always take precedence over personal ones. It is ultimately a balancing act that needs to be monitored constantly.— Datuk Abdul Farid Alias,
Group President & CEO,
Malayan Banking Bhd (winning company of the 2015 awards) How did Sime Darby Group sustain employee trust amidst the leadership changes following the demerger?
With the new leadership team in place, we set out to meet with groups of employees across our operations. These sessions were essentially open platforms for employees to air any concerns or questions they had, and for them to share their thoughts and ideas for the new organisation. They also provided us the opportunity to communicate our new vision, strategy and targets, and to project the new culture for Sime Darby Bhd.  — Datuk Jeffri Salim Davidson,
Group CEO,
Sime Darby Bhd (winning company of the 2017 awards) How can leaders articulate trust in a simple yet meaningful manner to their employees?  
For leaders to express trust to their employees, there must be commitment to a purpose that entails creating a better future for their people. Not only is it important for employees to know that their leader is committed to a worthy purpose; the leader must pursue that purpose based on the right set of values.  Deeply held values play a huge role in earning trust. Earning the trust of one’s employees is not just a soft, nice-to-have asset; it is the hard currency that makes a difference between success and failure.How can leaders build trust for their organisation’s long-lasting success?
Leaders build trust for their organisations through their actions – by setting direction that creates meaningful value for their stakeholders and enables empowered decision-making. In addition, leaders focus on designing the structures, deploying the right resources and supporting systems to execute the strategy. Underpinning all this, is the accountability for creating a culture of long-lasting excellence based on the right values and leading by example.—  Rajeev Peshawaria,

The 29.8% stake in TH Heavy Engineering Bhd is an example. Urusharta Jamaah paid RM380.3 million for the block of 334.16 million shares, compared with its market value of RM10.02 million. The lowest premium is on the block of 65.51 million shares in MISC Bhd, which was transferred at RM486.53 million, or a 10.85% premium over its value of RM438.93 million at end-2018, according to the list attached to the written reply from Prime Minister Departments (PMD) to Dewan Rakyat yesterday.PMD highlighted in the reply that if prudent accounting standard was practiced by LTH in the past, the pilgrim fund would have been able to continue holding onto these assets. Its reply said the assets acquired by Urusharta can be categorised into three types: properties, a non-listed company, and public listed securities.Urusharta is a special purpose vehicle set up by the government to revive LTH’s financial health caused by the large deficit between its assets and liabilities. It is acquiring the pilgrims fund’s underperforming properties and equities in exchange for RM10 billion in non-tradable sukuk, and RM9.9 billion in Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares as part of its restructuring plan.By exchanging its RM10 billion non-performing assets for RM19.9 billion worth of sukuk and Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares, it will help remove the pilgrim fund’s massive impairments on its assets.  The restructuring plan will ensure the fund will be able to make hibah distributions according to the Tabung Haji Act 1995, said PMD.PMD said overall, the assets transferred from LTH to the SPV comprises 29 properties, one company that is not public listed, and equity stake or derivatives in 106 public listed companies.“If a prudent impairment rate has been practiced previously by the old management, not at 90% level, and the provision of impairment is made on the profit and loss statements in the past years, of course, LTH will be capable of continuing to hold all of these shares,” it added.PMD pointed out that over the past few years, all of these equity losses were parked under ‘other reserves’ in LTH’s financial statements in order to continue showing high profit, and to ensure there were hibah payments every year. Consequently, this has resulted in the widening gap between its assets and liabilities.PMD said based on LTH’s audited financial statements for 2017, ‘other reserves’ shows a negative value of RM4.6 billion.Therefore, PMD said the government’s intention is to restore LTH’s financial position by taking over these losses to close the widening deficit.PMD said Urusharta Jamaah’s role now is to implement rehabilitation for these assets through warehousing strategy and restructuring, while continuing the operations of the transferred assets to maximise their recovery value.On top of that, PMD said Urusharta Jamaah will redeem all the financial instruments it issued and subscribed by LTH.The issue of LTH's asset transfers was raised by Ahmad Amzad Mohamed @ Hashim (PAS-Kuala Terengganu) yesterday, who had asked the Prime Minister to state the value of each asset (equity and property) that has been transferred to Syarikat Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd by LTH.PropertiesNon-listed CompanyDomestic equity securities",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/pms-dept-if-tabung-haji-practices-prudent-accounting-govt-wont-need-take-over-assets-premium

Their resignations will take effect on April 1.“In ensuring our commitment towards customers is continuously fulfilled in line with our next phase of transformation into ‘New TM’ — a customer-centric organisation — via the Performance Improvement Programme 2019-2021, their positions will be covered by the senior officials who are currently their direct reports,” said TM.With the departure of Ahmad Azhar as the CDO, the Group Digital Centre (GDC) will be overseen by general manager Hizam Ghazali, who has been part of the GDC since 2018.“Hizam will continue the effort of realising TM’s strategic thrust of empowering digital,” said TM.In the interim, Asmawati Yusof, chief network and IT architecture with 33 years of experience in the technical field, will assume the role of the CTIO, a position vacated by Mohd Rais.Meanwhile, the role of CISO will be covered by the head, Mohd Nazri Zawawi. With 21 years of service in TM, Mohd Nazri has been attached to group information security since its formation in 2017.Notably, TM’s management has undergone several changes in the past nine months, including the resignation of managing director and group chief executive officer (CEO) Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazalli Ramly in June last year.Its then executive director and deputy group CEO Datuk Bazlan Osman, who was appointed as acting group CEO following Mohammed Shazalli’s departure, resigned from the top post in November last year.For the interim, TM has appointed chief operating officer Imri Mokhtar to become acting group CEO.In December last year, TM appointed Rosli Man as a non-independent and non-executive chairman of the group effective immediately, replacing Tan Sri Dr Sulaiman Mahbob, who resigned on Nov 30 last year.A quick check on TM’s website shows that Mohd Rais, 53, was appointed CTIO effective Feb 18 last year, and CISO since Jan 1, 2017.Formerly the deputy CTIO in 2017 and appointed vice-president of network architecture and technology in 2010, he was instrumental in various transformation projects in TM including the national high-speed broadband (HSBB) project launched in March 2010.As for Ahmad Azhar, a 54-year-old who joined TM as group chief information officer in August 2004, he has been involved in strategic planning and change management, business and operations support systems, enterprise resource management, revenue and customer relationship management.He was later appointed TM programme director for the HSBB project in 2008, and contributed to the successful launch of UniFi.Ahmad Azhar assumed various positions in TM; including chief strategy officer and chief customer advocate, before he was appointed CDO in October 2016 to head TM’s digital transformation initiatives throughout the group.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/more-clevel-departures-tm

GLCs are in the middle, but what is their role? It should be more clearly defined,” he told reporters after taking part in a forum on the sustainability of economic corridors.Sulaiman was formerly the director of the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in the Prime Minister’s Office and head of the National Economic Advisory Council during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.He said when he was Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) chairman, the GLC carried out many social responsibility programmes, including providing scholarships and helping Bumiputera vendors.""TM had to shoulder many responsibilities. You can’t compare Telekom to Maxis, it’s like comparing apples with oranges. TM also conducted research and development,” he said.Sulaiman however declined to comment on the government’s stated intention of weighing various options before making a decision on the fate of Malaysia Airlines.Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad was reported as saying yesterday that closing down the airline was a serious matter, and the government would study the situation before deciding whether to shut down the airline, divest its assets, or refinance its debts. — Bernama

(March 12, RM3.25)
Downgrade to neutral with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM3.60: Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) saw a challenging 2018 with headline net profit falling over 80% — core earnings were down 27% — following the Mandatory Standard Access Pricing (MSAP) implementation resulting in a lower revenue and margin, as well as higher impairments. For 2019, we see an easing of regulatory pressures, though the dust may not have settled as we had yet to witness the full impact of the cut in wholesale prices as customers could still switch to cheaper packages.We expect a more significant impact on the retail segment with Unifi’s higher average revenue per user (Arpu) falling 15%, while there may still be further provisions in the wholesale segment, though the amount could be smaller than that in financial year 2018 (FY18). Meanwhile, we think an accelerated depreciation or impairment on outdated fixed network assets may persist in FY19 forecast. Since our upgrade on Nov 27, 2018, TM’s share price has risen 38%. Given a less compelling upside to our discounted cash flow (DCF)-based TP of RM3.60, we cut our rating from “trading buy” to “neutral”.In FY18, TM recognised a provision of RM169.2 million arising from an estimated impact of the MSAP. We believe there could still be a further provision but the amount may be smaller than what was recognised in FY18, which should have taken into account the key services governed under the MSAP. As TM is still finalising rates with access seekers, we think there could still be some space for a further provision on perhaps the unregulated services, though the amount could be lower. Meanwhile, the retail segment should also be affected by a more substantial decline in Arpu. We assumed a 15% decline in Unifi’s Arpu to RM163 in FY19F, compared with only a 4% drop in FY18. Overall, we estimate FY19F revenue to fall 7% mainly due to a lower data and Internet revenue.In FY18, TM also recognised an impairment of RM982.5 million on its fixed and wireless network assets, mainly due to technology obsolescence. Based on our estimate, the book value of TM’s telecommunication networks as at Dec 31, 2018 could be about RM10 billion. We worked out that accumulated impairment on network assets provided thus far amounted to RM1.2 billion, recognised in FY16 to FY18. We’re not ruling out the possibility of a further impairment or an accelerated depreciation to be made in future, particularly for its outdated copper cable network where its fair value could have fallen below its recorded cost due to rapid technological changes.TM’s core earnings will not be affected by the provision and impairment as these items are excluded when evaluating the business’ underlying performance. We are maintaining our core earnings forecasts. However, we believe there could be some downside risks in terms of headline profit due to a potential impairment on its obsolete fixed network assets, which could lead to a lower dividend per share as its 40% to 60% payout guidance is based on reported figures. — PublicInvest Research, March 12",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/regulatory-pressure-easing-likely-tm

"March 11, 2019 14:00 pm +08",TM,"Lead Story: 4Q earnings weaker year on year, but an improvement over 3Q","CORPORATE earnings for the last quarter of last year (4Q2018) were hit by external and domestic uncertainties as 476 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia saw a decline in their financial performance compared with a year ago. Only 391 companies saw an improvement in their earnings per share (EPS).A look at the earnings results last week by The Edge found that 257 companies had recorded a decline in EPS, 145 slipped into the red and 74 saw their losses widen compared with the previous year. Only 224 companies recorded EPS growth with 113 turning profitable and 54 narrowing their losses.According to Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau, 4Q earnings were largely in line with expectations, as seen by some of the earnings downgrades towards the end of last year.“If you look at the market, most analysts cut their earnings projections last year. This was reflected by the decline in the stock market. As we have seen, the lacklustre third-quarter earnings have continued into the fourth quarter, albeit with a bit of improvement,” Lau says.Indeed, 4Q earnings were slightly better than 3Q’s, with 249 companies recording EPS growth versus 228 that contracted.Bloomberg data shows that the construction sector was among those affected as 27 players saw a decline in earnings versus 11 that recorded growth.Apart from construction, property, food packaging and plantations were among the top losers. The logistics sector also saw an increase in underperformers as competition in the space intensified.The banking sector had a relatively good 2018, but results were mixed in the last quarter, a notable decline was seen in Public Bank Bhd’s EPS on a year-on-year basis.The automotive and oil and gas sectors look fairly interesting as there are selective opportunities for investors, given that some companies turned around in 4Q.MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman says the results have generally met expectations — banks, healthcare and construction companies under its coverage look good.Other sectors turned in mixed results, a notable loser being plantations, owing to lower crude palm oil (CPO) prices in 4Q2018.“Looking at the winners, we reckon it is better to look at company specifics. For example, those related to commodity prices. While the price of oil was high for the first half of 4Q (until around mid-November), most oil and gas counters saw weak earnings. Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd did well, aided by a higher plant utilisation rate and selling prices, while Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd’s increased work orders for its maintenance services resulted in strong top and bottom-line growth,” Redza says.Even though the environment in the O&G space remains challenging, 11 companies managed to turn profitable during the quarter, including Dayang Enterprise and Velesto Energy Bhd.Redza observes that although the higher oil price did not create a clear winner in the O&G industry, it did impact the aviation sector. AirAsia Group Bhd and AirAsia X Bhd flew into the red during 4Q, while Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd’s (MAHB) earnings (excluding one-off gains) were also below expectations.He adds that other winners include IHH Healthcare Bhd and UEM Edgenta Bhd.Another winner was the insurance industry. Tune Protect Group Bhd and Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga Bhd did well, driven by the travel reinsurance segment and higher net earned contributions respectively.“There was good earnings recovery for some of the telcos but Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd saw a drastic deterioration in earnings,” Redza says.Moving forward, he believes there will be some upside, especially on the commodity front, as higher CPO prices and recovering palm oil exports will boost plantation companies.“Construction players will also see better outcomes as uncertainties over project awards become a thing of the past, and we have seen a slew of contracts won by companies such as Sunway Construction Group Bhd, Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd, KKB Engineering Bhd and Hock Seng Lee Bhd, which have been announced in recent months.“It looks like our bullish view on infrastructure development in Sarawak has come to fruition,” Redza says, adding that upward revisions to earnings expectations are on the cards. However, they are unlikely to be across the board amid uncertainties over geopolitical issues.Lau agrees with Redza. He says that even some companies that were perceived to be linked to the previous government managed to record strong earnings.MyEG Services Bhd was one such, posting strong quarterly earnings of RM58.1 million, or 1.7 sen per share, translating into a net margin of about 50%.Most companies warn that the outlook for 2019 remains cautious amid uncertainties over geopolitical tensions in the form of the US-China trade war, Brexit and regional elections.“The key risks remain those on the external front, such as the US-China trade negotiations,” Lau opines.But another fund manager with a local asset management firm believes that local political developments will play an even more critical role as corporates are looking at Pakatan Harapan’s policies and direction before making any investment decisions.“Most of the guidance for 2019 has been for cautious optimism. It is because many are waiting to see if there is any impact from some of the changes made by the new government.“We are also seeing that the government is talking about potentially continuing with some of the infrastructure projects that are under heavy scrutiny, such as the ECRL (East Coast Rail Link) project,” he says. The FBM KLCI’s EPS fell 10% y-o-y in 2018The FBM KLCI component stocks saw 2018 EPS fall by about a tenth compared with a year ago, with Axiata and Genting Malaysia Bhd being the top losers. Both companies slipped into a net loss. The gaming counter slid into its first annual loss since 2000, of 3.5 sen per share, while the telco saw its first full-year loss of 55.6 sen per share since listing in 2008.Twelve of the 30 component stocks also posted weaker performances last year compared with 2017. They include plantation players Sime Darby Plantations Bhd and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK).Petronas Dagangan Bhd’s EPS also dropped about 45% to 85.5 sen last year, from FY2017.MAHB, on the other hand, was the top performer last year with a tripling of its EPS, mainly due to an unrealised gain on the fair value of its investment in GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd.The airport operator was followed by IOI Corp Bhd and Top Glove Bhd.The banking sector was also one of last year’s bright spots, based on the growth recorded by CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, RHB Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, AMMB Holdings Bhd and Malayan Banking Bhd.An analyst at a local investment bank believes investors had priced in weaker 4Q earnings. Their instinct proved spot-on as the equity benchmark index shrank 5.9% last year. Year to date, it has gained 1% to close at 1,707.73 points last Thursday.While it is still early days, investors could be gearing up to put last year’s underperformance behind them in the belief that a gradual recovery could be in place. There are some signs pointing in that direction. The Bursa Malaysia Construction Index plunged 50% last year, but is one of the top performers year to date, with a gain of 15.7%.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-4q-earnings-weaker-year-year-improvement-over-3q
"March 07, 2019 10:56 am +08",TM,"Mixed results for telco sector amid moderating regulatory pressures","Telecommunications sector
Maintain neutral on the respective sectors: The telco sector’s fourth quarter of 2018 (4Q18) results were somewhat mixed as normalised earnings of Digi.Com Bhd and Axiata Group Bhd came in within expectations while Telekom Malaysia (TM) Bhd did not suffer profit erosion as bad as we had expected from the mandatory standard access pricing (MSAP) regime and repriced Unifi options. 
Time dotcom Bhd’s (TIME) results were stronger than expectations with its second half (2H) earnings coming in above the management’s guidance due to continued fixed broadband growth in the wholesale, retail and enterprise markets. Maxis underperformed due to additional costs for productivity enhancement and marketing for its fiberised solutions targeting the enterprise segment.As Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo has recently indicated that high-speed broadband prices will not be cut this year, TM’s earnings prospects have stabilised for now with around 90% of its Streamyx and Unifi existing customers having been upgraded to faster speed packages while experiencing minimal downtrading activities together with manageable revenue declines in its financial year 2018 (FY18). This was supported by TIME’s experience wherein customers took up faster speed packages versus (vs) more affordable options.Cellular operators’ (celco) 4Q18 net profit fell 30% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) and year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM790 million largely even though revenue improved, up 1% q-o-q and 5% y-o-y respectively, from higher average revenue per user (Arpu) and postpaid subscribers for Celcom and Digi. The lower bottom line stemmed from a six percentage points q-o-q decline in net profit margin to 13% from Maxis’ additional marketing/operational costs and Celcom’s higher depreciation and tax charges.Total subscribers continued to contract amid tight competition and ongoing SIM consolidation, declining q-o-q by 344,000 subscribers and 723,000 subscribers y-o-y to 31 million subscribers. A major portion of the y-o-y decline stemmed from Celcom, which lost 470,000 subscribers while Maxis shed 167,000 subscribers and Digi 86,000 subscribers. These contractions stemmed purely from the prepaid segment, which shrank by 606,000 subscribers q-o-q and 1.5 million subscribers y-o-y to 22.5 million subscribers.While the prepaid subscriber base continued to dwindle, the higher value postpaid segment grew by 262,000 subscribers (3%) q-o-q and 790,000 subscribers (10%) y-o-y respectively. This underpinned the celco service revenue momentum, which increased by 1% q-o-q and 5% y-o-y, to RM6 billion as blended Arpu rose by RM1 per month to RM49 per month.Maxis remained the revenue leader despite Digi’s larger subscriber base. Digi continued to command the largest subscriber market share at 37% vs Maxis’ 34% while Celcom remained a distant third at 29%. Digi’s pole position since 1Q16 stemmed largely from its strength in the prepaid segment, underpinned by the migrant population. However, Maxis was stronger in the postpaid segment with an Arpu and subscriber base which were 29% and 14% respectively higher than Digi’s. This placed Maxis in the leading position with a 2018 revenue market share of 40% vs 32% for Celcom and 28% for Digi.Maxis, which is already an established player in the fiberised solutions via the leasing of TM’s high-speed broadband network, is aiming to penetrate more aggressively the business and enterprise markets by offering converged offerings. Celcom has started offering home fibre solutions in Sabah while Digi is testing the waters at the Jasin pilot project in Melaka.Since the middle of 2018, no celco has launched a comparable package to counter U Mobile Sdn Bhd’s prepaid GX30 which offers unlimited data with speeds up to 3Mbps for just RM30 per month. Recall that U Mobile also launched postpaid GX50 which provides unlimited voice and data with speeds up to 5Mbps for RM50 per month.Postpaid plans for Digi remained at RM58 per month for 10GB data, Celcom offers RM80 per month for 20GB data and Maxis RM98 per month for 40GB. However, Digi also offers unlimited voice and data plans via online registration at a higher priced RM100 per month for speeds of up to 10Mbps, similar to Unifi mobile’s unlimited voice and data plan at RM99 per month.Even though there appeared to be a half-year ceasefire in the postpaid wars, near- to medium-term revenue growth outlook remains weak against the backdrop of persistent pressure to gain market share. As U Mobile and Unifi mobile wrestle for new customers on the unlimited mobile data arena, prospects for incremental service revenue accretions are unexciting at this stage, underscored by the sector’s tepid forward momentum over the past years.Maintain “neutral” call given the continued intense competition in both the mobile and fixed broadband markets. We have “hold” calls on Axiata, TM and Digi while Maxis is “underweight” due to its premium valuations despite its financial year 2019 forecast (FY19F) guidance for an Ebitda decline amid additional capital expenditure for fiberised solutions, digitalisation and productivity capabilities. — AmInvestment Bank, March 6",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mixed-results-telco-sector-amid-moderating-regulatory-pressures
"March 06, 2019 08:31 am +08",TM,"Khazanah posts first pre-tax loss since 2005","KUALA LUMPUR: Khazanah Nasional Bhd posted its first pre-tax loss in 13 years in 2018, amid significant impairment provisions made during the year — a big chunk of which was due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAB) — but hopes to return to profitability in 2019.The sovereign wealth fund reported a pre-tax loss of RM6.3 billion for 2018, compared to its pre-tax profit of RM2.9 billion in the preceding year, after recording impairments totalling RM7.3 billion — more than triple the RM2.3 billion seen in 2017.The last time it fell into the red was in 2005, when the fund reported a pre-tax loss of RM831 million.Khazanah managing director (MD) Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan said the sizeable impairment reflected the drop in market value of the share prices of listed stocks the fund holds, as well as the decline in the fair carrying value of some of its unlisted assets.“Our performance in 2018 was impacted by several key global and domestic developments in both the economic and social spheres. At the same time, the government initiated a reset of Khazanah, which involved significant changes including a refreshed mandate,” he said at the Khazanah annual review yesterday.The fund received RM2.8 billion in dividends from its investments in 2018, down 9.7% from the RM3.1 billion it recorded in the previous year, while divestment gains halved to RM1.4 billion for the year from RM2.8 billion, reflecting the challenging market conditions during the year.“Looking ahead into 2019, Khazanah should be able to return to profit, given the fact that the clean-up we did in 2018 has gone through the books. We don’t expect any more large impairments that we have to go through again in 2018.“The provisions are primarily due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd, which accounted for roughly half of the total impairments for 2018,” he said.Its portfolio’s realisable asset value (RAV) — or the market value of all equities, securities and cash held — fell to RM136 billion in 2018 from RM157 billion a year ago. In terms of net worth adjusted — which is RAV less total liabilities and adjusted to measure value created — that fell 21.6% to RM91 billion from RM116 billion, weighed by subdued earnings outlook, market volatility and regulatory changes. Challenging conditions in the airline industryShahril said the airline industry is challenging, as he pointed to persistent overcapacity and how airlines in the country, such as the region’s leading low-cost airline AirAsia Bhd, are also struggling.While Malaysia Airlines was a drag on Khazanah’s financials for 2018, he justified the fund’s investment in the airline by saying that it provides other economic benefits to the country beyond the fund’s bottom line. As an example, he cited the connectivity it provides that brings business and leisure travellers into Malaysia, which indirectly contributes to the economy.However, he said that does not discount the fact that the national airline should be as operationally efficient as possible.“Quite clearly, the strategy put in place for Malaysia Airlines has not met its objectives. That is a fact we have to acknowledge. The question now is whether it makes sense to continue with the same strategy or do we need to rethink how the airline operates given the challenging environment?“We are waiting for Malaysia Airlines to complete its review and we will be looking at understanding what that startegy requires,” he said. Drop in TM’s market valueAnother factor that drove Khazanah into the red was Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), which saw a substantial fall in market value following the 83% drop in the group’s net profit for 2018, which Shahril attributed to regulatory changes.TM registered a 56.9% decline in total returns, the biggest decliner in Khazanah’s portfolio, followed by Axiata Group Bhd (-26.9%), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-9.3%), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-7.9%), IHH Healthcare Bhd (-7.6%) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (-3.3%).Shahril said the market has priced in the fact that TM will take some time to improve its cost base, following the government’s move to bring down consumer pricing as quickly as possible.As the telecommunications company shifts its pricing to reflect the new regulatory environment, revenue will be affected, he said, but added that profitability will return given time. Portfolio rebalancing to spread risk concentrationMeanwhile, Shahril said the fund will remain focused on executing its portfolio rebalancing strategy and strengthening its financial position.He stressed that Khazanah is looking at long-term returns and that it is natural for there to be fluctuations in the market over long periods of time, especially since the fund’s portfolio is very much equity-based. “The key thing to focus on is the fact that we are restructuring the portfolio and are geared towards long-term returns,” Shahril said.The portfolio rebalancing, he said, will look at taking out some of the inherent risks in its portfolio, such as the concentration of risk it is facing given that a big chunk of its investments in Malaysia are tied up in just a few companies. So, over time, Khazanah will have a more balanced portfolio spread over more sectors and geographies to mitigate the concentration of risk, and benefit from a more diversified portfolio.Khazanah is also splitting its portfolio into two — commercial and strategic. The commercial portion targets returns equivalent to inflation plus 3% on a five-year rolling basis. It will comprise public assets such as CIMB, Axiata, IHH and Alibaba.com as well as private assets such as The Holstein Milk Company Sdn Bhd, Sun Life Malaysia, WeLab and Palantir.The strategic portion is a developmental fund targeting returns equivalent to the 10-year Malaysian Government Securities yield on a five-year rolling basis. It includes strategic assets such as TM, TNB, MAB and PLUS Malaysia Bhd and developmental assets such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Themed Attractions Resorts & Hotels Sdn Bhd, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and Medini Iskandar Malaysia.Meanwhile, as part of the review of the fund’s operational costs, Khazanah is looking at the operations of its international offices and may take steps to improve their operations.“Some of our offices are quite vital to our operations, like China, for example. We have a lot of investments in the country and a lot of these are private equity investments, so we need people on the ground to ensure those assets are managed well and are creating value for Khazanah as a whole.“Some of the other offices, for instance in London, may be less important because we will be adopting a more market-driven approach. So, we can do more of the operations out of other offices. As we review our costs and business operations, if there is a cost benefit to us by running the international offices in a different way, we will make those decisions as we go along,” he said. Not in talks with any party for Legoland saleMeanwhile, when asked if Khazanah had received offers for Legoland Malaysia Resort — following a news report that the fund is looking to sell the theme park — Shahril said Khazanah is not in talks with any party, though the the fund is reviewing all its assets.“Legoland is not only Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) positive — it’s returning a positive profit as well. The time will come when we need to think about reinvesting the capital.“Everything has a value at the end of the day and if a great valuation comes in, we will look and see whether the capital that can be returned to our books can be better deployed in other areas,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/khazanah-posts-first-pretax-loss-2005

""By being much more portfolio-based, you will have basically a lot more transactions happening as well.""Reuters reported last month, citing sources, that Khazanah's new strategy was aimed at delivering more cash to the government by pruning stakes in non-strategic assets.Khazanah will split investments in over 100 firms spanning more than 20 countries into two categories, Reuters reported.On Tuesday, Khazanah said the realisable asset value of its portfolio fell to RM136 billion (US$33.4 billion) in 2018 from RM157 billion a year prior.Its investments in companies including 27%-owned CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and 37%-owned Axiata Group Bhd as well as in China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd would become part of its commercial fund.Khazanah's stakes in CIMB, Axiata and IHH Healthcare Bhd are together worth US$12.2 billion, Reuters calculations showed based on Monday closing share prices.In November, Khazanah agreed to sell a 16% stake in IHH for about US$2 billion, a transaction it expects to complete by March-end.The commercial fund, which is aimed at growing financial assets and diversifying national revenue sources, will target a return equivalent to Malaysia's Consumer Price Index plus 3% on a five-year rolling basis, Khazanah said.A big chunk of Khazanah's assets is in only a few companies, which would have to be restructured gradually to enable a more balanced portfolio spread over sectors and geographies, Shahril said. The government also needed Khazanah as an alternative source of revenue to supplement its national budget, he said.Firms such as state utility Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd will be part of Khazanah's strategic fund.For the first time in a decade, Khazanah said it swung to a loss before tax of RM6.27 billion in 2018 from a profit before tax of RM2.89 billion in 2017, hit by reduced divestment, higher impairments and a lower dividend income.Shahril said Khazanah expected to return to profit this year. The fund announced a dividend of RM1.5 billion to the government for 2018.Shahril also said the government needed to take a call on its investment in struggling Malaysia Airlines.""The question really to be asked essentially is for every dollar invested in Malaysia Airlines, is it generating other economic benefits to the country? The government then needs to decide for itself what is the right level of investment or support for the airline at this point in time,"" Shahril said.(US$1 = RM4.0750)",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/khazanah-restructures-fund-two-groups-posts-weak-2018-results
"March 04, 2019 16:00 pm +08",TM,"TIME best performer in Khazanah’s commercial pool","AN underperformer in its early incarnation, TIME dotCom Bhd has evolved over the decades and is now the top performer in Khazanah Nasional Bhd’s commercial fund where the latter pools assets focused on long-term growth targets.Khazanah also has a fund that contains assets deemed to be in line with its strategic role of helping develop Malaysia. According to the company’s new managing director, Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan, its strategic fund only contains Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airlines Bhd and the Iskandar Malaysia economic zone in Johor.Its commercial fund holds more companies and includes CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, UEM Edgenta Bhd and UEM Sunrise Bhd.In his first interview with The Edge as managing director of Khazanah last week, Shahril made it clear that the company’s new approach to its commercial fund will be fully portfolio-based, but noted that it will take time to restructure its portfolio.A number of solid companies stand out.Bloomberg data shows that TIME is one of the outperformers in Khazanah’s portfolio as the telecommunications company has provided a total return of 913% over the last 10 years, translating into a compound annual gain of 26% over that period. That is impressive by most standards.Over the same period, UEM Edgenta, CIMB Group and Axiata also saw a strong run-up in their share prices, giving total returns of 658%, 149% and 142% respectively.Asia’s largest hospital operator, IHH Healthcare, is another outperformer with a total return of 79% since its listing in 2012, while UEM Sunrise yielded 49% over a 10-year period.An exception is dominant pay-television operator Astro Malaysia, whose share price has declined 22% since relisting on Bursa Malaysia in 2012, two years after it was taken private by tycoon T Ananda Krishnan.With such a portfolio, it will be interesting to see if Khazanah will dispose of its stars to capitalise on their profits, or cut its losses on some of the underperformers.Investors are keeping a close watch in the light of Khazanah’s disposal of a 16% stake in IHH Healthcare to Mitsui & Co Ltd for RM8.42 billion.Also of interest is the investment space occupied by Axiata, TIME and TM.“It will be interesting to see what happens next with Khazanah’s investment in Axiata and TIME. If the sovereign wealth fund is looking to manage its fund in a portfolio approach, it will have to diversify away from the telecoms industry. They are competing on the same front, along with TM. But if you look at Khazanah’s stakes in Axiata and TIME, it will also be hard for any disposal to be done due to liquidity constraints.“Of course, one can always argue that Axiata has a regional presence while TIME has a strong track record,” a fund manager with a local asset management company tells The Edge.Indeed, Khazanah’s share of value in the Malaysian telecoms sector amounts to some RM17 billion — more than a tenth of the sovereign wealth fund’s total realisable asset value of RM157.2 billion (as at Dec 31, 2017).Some question whether exposure in a sector known to be saturated both in terms of subscribers and competition will help the fund meet its long-term asset growth target.Analysts covering both TIME and Axiata, nonetheless, remain optimistic, based on their recommendations and target prices.For TIME, six out of seven analysts have a “buy” call, while the remaining one has a “hold”, with the 12-month average target price of RM9.47, indicating an upside potential of 15.1%.As for Axiata, 19 analysts have a “buy” and 10 have a “hold”, with the 12-month average target price of RM4.50, indicating a return potential of 5.1%.Bloomberg data estimates that Khazanah paid an average cost per share for TIME of RM1.67 and for Axiata of RM2.38, indicating a healthy profit gain should the fund decide to take profit. The average cost per share uses Khazanah’s historical holdings during its entire holding period and the volume weighted average price of the security during each period.Apart from the telcos, its investment in CIMB Group has also been profitable as Bloom­berg data shows that Khazanah’s average cost per share was RM3.40, indicating a return of about 71% in the event of a disposal.Its 92.5%-owned Indonesian banking arm, PT Bank CIMB Niaga Tbk, also appears to be performing more solidly, posting a 16.95% growth in net profit to IDR3.48 trillion (RM1.01 billion) for the year ended Dec 31 last year, on the back of an improvement in non-interest income and credit charges.Currently, there are 11 “buy” and an equal number of “hold” calls on CIMB Group with an average target price of RM6.39, indicating an upside potential of 10.2%.Ahmad Ramzani Ramli, an analyst at Kenanga, is one of those who have down­graded the stock to a “hold” because of demanding valuations amid challenging loan growth, an uptick in credit charges as well as downside pressure on net interest margin.UEM Edgenta — held through Khazanah’s wholly-owned subsidiary, UEM Group Bhd — has also been profitable for the fund, posting a gain of about 14% since 2014.The country’s largest integrated facilities management (IFM) provider, the company covers consultancy, services and solutions for the healthcare, infrastructure and real estate segments.A research house covering UEM Edgenta believes the compound annual growth rate of about 9% in the IFM market is positive for the company. In the past year, UEM Edgenta has yielded a total return of about 20% and all three of the analysts covering the stock have maintained their “buy” call with an average target price of RM3.25, indicating a return potential of 17.3%.The winners aside, Shahril has acknow­ledged the possibility of cutting losers. Bloom­berg data estimates the average cost per share of its investment in UEM Sunrise at RM1.22, indicating a potential loss of about 31%. It is worth noting that the group has been on a downward trend with a decline of about 65% in the last five years, although to be fair, nearly all property players are likely to be in the same boat given the dismal state of the property market.As for Astro Malaysia, investors have shied away from the stock as digital pirated copies, streaming as well as Android TV boxes with pre-loaded software give consumers access to content either for free or for a small sum — usually through illegal channels — taking away some of the pay-TV operator’s previous dominance.The emergence of giant media services player Netflix — another significant threat — along with smaller players such as iflix and dimsum.my, has noticeably raised the competition for eyeballs.Khazanah’s investment in Astro Malaysia — held via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pantai Cahaya Bulan Ventures Sdn Bhd — could have shrunk by about a third, based on Bloomberg estimates.It is interesting to note that Khazanah was Ananda’s partner in the 2010 privatisation of Astro Malaysia. Both parties had offered RM4.30 per share for the remaining 27.09% not owned by their special purpose vehicle, Astro Holdings Sdn Bhd. The price was at a 5.9% premium to Astro Malaysia’s IPO price of RM4.06 when it first listed in October 2003.The competitive environment notwithstanding, most analysts believe there is value in the media company as it has lost about 30% of its value in the past year. CIMB Equity Research analyst Kamarul Anwar believes regulatory intervention to block access to illegal channels will be a positive catalyst for Astro Malaysia.He has an “add” call for Astro Malaysia with a target price of RM1.75, citing its strong yield of 6.4% as a positive. Most analysts have the same view, with 11 “buy” and seven “hold” calls. The average target price is RM1.81, indicating a return potential of 9.7%.At the recent Kuala Lumpur Digital Content Anti-Piracy Summit, Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo suggested that all related agencies should be placed under one ministry to combat digital piracy.While it is too early to tell which of the companies under Khazanah’s commercial fund would be deemed “low hanging fruit” under its new mandate, the fresh direction points to interesting times for the Malaysian capital market, although sceptics observe that there had already been a few rounds of heightened activity under the previous administrations.Proponents of Khazanah divesting its stake in government-linked companies will point to a higher free float as a positive for the domestic equities market. The sovereign wealth fund will also have more firepower to increase its international exposure and diversify its investments.The larger liquidity could spur the capital market, which has remained largely stagnant over the last two to three years. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/time-best-performer-khazanahs-commercial-pool
"March 04, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TM,"The State of the Nation: EPF beats expectations on dividend and impairment ","IT would seem that the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) — the statutory guardian of the retirement kitty of private-sector wage earners — is perpetually stuck between a rock and a hard place. After proving critics wrong by announcing a stellar dividend despite the challenging operating environment last year, speculation has turned to how it managed the feat.On Feb 16, the EPF declared a 6.15% dividend for its conventional portfolio and 5.9% for Simpanan Shariah — way above the speculated low of four plus per cent, purportedly on sizeable write-downs, given how badly equities performed last year.Some critics pointed to 2016 when the EPF had a RM8.18 billion net impairment loss. That year, the dividend dipped to 5.7% from 6.4% in 2015 when net impairment was RM3.07 billion.Most of the impairment (net of any write-backs) was from listed financial assets with a small portion coming from unlisted subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. In 2015, the EPF saw a RM321 million net write-back on the unlisted investments that negated part of the RM3.4 billion net impairment on its listed financial assets.Yet based on the 2018 preliminary figures released by the EPF last Monday, the implied net impairment to its total income for the year was little changed from the RM3 billion plus seen in 2015 and 2017.For 2018, the EPF’s gross investment income was RM50.88 billion while total dividend payout was RM47.32 billion. It is not immediately known whether the EPF’s 2018 total income benefited from non-investment income. Audited accounts will be out in April when its 2018 annual report is released.When asked, CEO Tunku Alizakri Alias declines to disclose the size of the impairment for 2018, noting that the year’s accounts still needed to be audited by the Auditor-General’s Department. Nonetheless, he assures that the EPF “has always insisted on adhering to global best practices”, had implemented the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standard 9 (MFRS 9) since Jan 1, 2018, and had indicated as much when announcing its results for the first, second and third quarters of last year.“Under MFRS 9, all listed equity instruments have to be marked-to-market and recognised at fair value to reflect the actual market price of the assets,” Alizakri explains, dismissing as “mere speculation” that a change in accounting treatment boosted the EPF’s performance.“To further allay any misgivings, we also have in place strict cut-loss policies governing our equities to ensure the continued health of our balance sheet. Thus to allude that the EPF had arbitrarily decided to not carry out impairment on its listed equities in order to declare a higher dividend for 2018 is just not true,” he adds.As the EPF looks at investments from a long-term horizon, Alizakri says the retirement savings fund chose to classify its equity instruments using the Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) method as Fair Value through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) would expose it to volatility in earnings, especially due to temporary market cycles.While the EPF no longer recognises impairment or capital gains on disposal on its listed equity holdings in its statement of profit and loss, adjustments are still made to its retained earnings to reflect the correct worth of its assets.“There has never been, and there must never be, any political pressure or undue influence on the EPF to declare dividend figures,” Alizakri says, adding that this sentiment extends to “all aspects” of the EPF’s operational and investment activities.“Everything we do is towards meeting our mandate to safeguard and grow our members’ savings as well as deliver excellent services. We unequivocally state that the EPF, as a statutory body with a strong set of governance structures, is apolitically proud to be able to serve our members who represent all races and political affiliations,” he comments. “The EPF has strict governance in ensuring that the dividend declared is in accordance with our long-established policies and the relevant accounting standards. The decision on dividend rates has to go through various committees, including the Board Audit Committee, the Investment Panel and the EPF Board before they can be declared.”According to him, the EPF declares its annual dividend payout based solely on its net realised income for the year, which is derived from total gross realised income after deducting net impairment on financial assets (except listed equities), unrealised gains or losses from inter-company transactions, investment expenses, operating expenditure, statutory charges as well as dividend on withdrawals. “Therefore, we cannot arbitrarily declare higher dividends.”It is not immediately known if there were any sizeable gains or losses from the EPF’s involvement in the Battersea redevelopment project, where Apple Inc’s London headquarters will reportedly be based from late-2020 or early-2021. There were genuine concerns over rising costs and thinner project development margins, especially following a delay in the Northern Line rail extension and opening of a new station that was supposed to drive more traffic to Battersea.The EPF took a 20% stake in the Battersea project in 2012 with S P Setia Bhd and Sime Darby Property Bhd each taking 40%. Last December, PNB-Kwasa International 2 — which is 35% owned by the EPF and 65% by Permodalan Nasional Bhd — agreed to pay £1.583 billion (RM8.35 billion) for S P Setia and Sime Darby’s stake in Battersea Phase 2 Holding Co Ltd. Boost from overseas allocationStill, the EPF’s success in generating income overseas is a key reason it was able to pay strong dividends in recent years. In 2015, for instance, 48% of the EPF’s earnings were from overseas despite having only 25% of its assets invested outside Malaysia.In 2017, when the EPF paid its highest dividend in 21 years of 6.9%, overseas income made up 41.45% of gross investment income (GII) despite global assets making up only 28% of its assets. In other words, foreign income alone was enough to pay more than 3% dividend to all members in 2017.While the EPF’s earnings from abroad were not so high last year, foreign investment across all asset classes still contributed 37.52% to its gross investment income. While the proportion of its foreign assets fell to 26.7% last year from 28% in 2017, the absolute value was still estimated to be about RM1 billion higher year on year.Its estimated income of about RM19.1 billion from abroad last year was enough to pay about 2.5% dividends to all EPF members — down from 3.1% or RM22 billion in 2017 — which is also reflected in the year-on-year decline in the EPF’s conventional dividend of 6.15% last year versus 6.9% in 2017. Dividend for Simpanan Shariah also slipped to 5.9% last year from 6.4% in 2017. Some 55% to 60% of income from equities since 2013The EPF’s success in equities investment is the other factor supporting its strong dividends in recent years. Before 2010, less than one-third of its assets were in equities, which at most generated 35% of gross investment income. From the 27% allocation for 2009 equities rose to as much as 44% of the EPF’s asset allocation in 2015 before easing to 39.1% last year.Not only did the proportion of asset allocation to equities decline to 39.1% last year from 42.2% in 2017, it was the first time in at least 15 years that there was a year-on-year decline in the absolute amount of investments the EPF had in equities to about RM326.3 billion last year from RM334.2 billion in 2017.It is not known if the significant decline in several top local EPF holdings had any bearing on these figures.At the time of writing, the EPF had not released its top 30 equity holdings as at Dec 31, 2018, but a simplistic tabulation of 35 stocks that were among the EPF’s top 30 holdings in the past four quarters and its shareholding level from stock exchange filings as at end-2018, shows that the value of the 35 stocks had fallen roughly RM7.5 billion year on year as at end-2018 — if one were to make a simplistic assumption that its shareholding was the same as a year ago. The largest declines were in Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Sime Darby Plantations Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd, Digi.com Bhd and Maxis Bhd while the largest gains were in Public Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, PPB Group Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd.The EPF did not disclose the size of its steady income stream for last year, which was enough to pay nearly half of its dividend payout for 2017, back-of-the-envelope calculations show.Last year, the EPF’s gross investment income stood at RM46.26 billion (conventional) and RM4.62 billion (shariah), adding up to RM50.88 billion. This was slightly below the 2017 figures of RM48.54 billion (conventional) and RM4.6 billion (shariah), for a total of RM53.14 billion.Total dividend for last year was RM47.32 billion (conventional: RM43 billion, shariah: RM4.32 billion), lower than 2017’s RM48.13 billion (conventional: RM44.15 billion, shariah: RM3.98 billion). The amount needed to pay every 1% of dividend increased from RM7.02 billion in 2017 to RM7.72 billion last year.It is impossible to please everybody, yet Alizakri hopes that those who are disappointed with the EPF’s dividend for last year measure the fund’s performance against the very challenging market conditions it faced, especially in 4Q2018. The 6.15% dividend (conventional) is 3.65% above its target of at least 2.5% nominal dividend and 3.93% above its second target of delivering at least 2% real dividend on a rolling three-year basis.“We have been able to not only preserve but also enhance the value of our members’ savings by 87.5% through the dividends that we have distributed over the past 18 years (since 2000). In other words, if you had placed RM1,000 in savings with the EPF on Jan 1, 2000, the value of your savings on Dec 31, 2018, would have grown to RM1,875. If you had held on to your cash at home, you would have seen an erosion of that same amount of money by 35.2% to be worth only RM648 today,” he says.For members hoping to see stronger EPF dividends for this year, Alizakri has this to say: “I wish I had the power to guarantee that EPF dividends will be stronger this year as I would then have the power to dictate world events and influence global markets. The only promise I can give you is that we have in place solid processes and the best people to ensure that the EPF is in a position to take advantage of opportunities as well as to manage any crisis in as quick and efficient a manner as possible. Our members can also be further comforted that our robust and time-proven Strategic Asset Allocation will equip us with the ability to withstand short-term volatility and deliver a commendable performance to our members.” ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/state-nation-epf-beats-expectations-dividend-and-impairment
"February 28, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TM,"Cover Story: Man with a mandate","CONTRARY to speculation, Khazanah Nasional Bhd is not being shut down. Talk that Khazanah might be liquidated was why congratulations was not the first word that came to mind for many when Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan was plucked out of the highly successful Employees Provident Fund to fill the managing director’s seat at Khazanah in early August last year.Not only was it about a week after the entire Khazanah board had tendered their resignation, but Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had lamented how the sovereign wealth fund he set up in 1993 had veered away from its original purpose.One does not need a degree from Oxford or master’s from Cambridge, like Shahril has,  to know the 48-year-old needs to know upfront what Mahathir expects of him and Khazanah.“He just wanted assurance that I would be able to deliver in terms of success for Khazanah in the same way that I’ve done in the past for, say, EPF,” Shahril tells The Edge.Mahathir was also the prime minister when Shahril first came under Corporate Malaysia’s spotlight 18 years ago when he and Datuk Abdul Rahman Ahmad — now Permodalan Nasional Bhd president and CEO — were brought in to restructure the then debt-laden Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB) in 2001.What is perhaps Shahril’s largest feat to date is how he successfully rebalanced the EPF’s portfolio of assets to earn a lot more income than what they would have earned had he not directed more money outside Malaysia into dividend-paying stocks as well as alternative investments such as real estate and infrastructure, which provide a steady stream of income without taking on excessive risks.The portfolio rebalancing allowed the EPF to pay the highest dividend rate in 21 years last year of 6.9%, despite the amount required to pay 1% dividend having doubled from RM3.43 billion when he joined the EPF as deputy CEO of investments in November 2009 to RM7.02 billion in 2017. Shahril was EPF CEO from April 2013 until the Aug 3 announcement stating he would report for duty at Khazanah on Aug 20, 2018.Now, Shahril will be expected to rebalance Khazanah’s portfolio — not short-term selling of assets or shares to fill government coffers — but to turn Khazanah into a significant income generator for Malaysia — one that can sustainably supplement the federal government’s annual budget.“There has been this misconception that we are selling because the government needs money. Actually, that is not quite true. We are actually doing some disposals in order to rationalise the portfolio. For instance, we are highly concentrated in terms of our Malaysian exposure. From a more balanced point of view, we really should have more global exposure,” Shahril explains.“What we’re trying to do is to give more certainty to what we can deliver for government budgeting purposes. That commitment of about RM1 billion [dividend] a year is that certainty that we’re giving them,” he adds, explaining that the bulk of proceeds from any divestment stays in Khazanah for reinvestment to restructure its portfolio for longer-term gains.“As we restructure the portfolio and the portfolio starts to provide and generate the kind of returns that we think it should over the long term, that would give us more capacity, at that point in time, to look at a higher dividend to the government.”Indeed, the RM1 billion dividend the government expects from it for 2019 was what Khazanah paid the government in 2017, and lower than the RM1.5 billion Shahril said Khazanah paid in 2018. [It is understood that there is a discrepancy between the dividend Khazanah reports and what is stated under the government’s income records as the latter is prepared using cash accounting rather than accrual accounting.]Across the Causeway, Singapore’s annual budget has been enjoying what it calls a net income return contribution (NIRC) since 2000,  which covered nearly 20% of the city state’s government expenses last year.  The NIRC includes 50% net investment returns from Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd, GIC Pte Ltd and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.GIC and Temasek — with US$390 billion and US$375 billion assets under management (AUM) respectively — are the world’s eighth and ninth largest sovereign wealth funds, according to data from the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) Institute. GIC manages Singapore’s government reserves while Temasek is Singapore’s investment arm. SWF ranks Khazanah at No 25 with US$38.7 billion.According to Shahril, the biggest difference between Khazanah’s old and new mandate is “clarity on the long-term goal and vision”.Going forward, Khazanah’s portfolio will have a 70:30 split, with 70% of its assets falling under the “commercial” basket that is used to fulfil its long-term asset growth target. The remaining 30% will be its “strategic” basket, which, he says, fulfils a strategic role in the country’s development and encompasses Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airlines Bhd as well as Iskandar Investment Bhd.That leaves Khazanah’s previous core holdings such as Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, UEM Sunrise Bhd and its remaining 26% stake in IHH Healthcare Bhd in the “commercial” pool that it will monetise, if the right value exists. Citing its deal with Mitsui & Co on IHH, Shahril assures other investors that Khazanah will not make any move that is counterproductive to its own portfolio value.He also says Khazanah cannot simply apply a blanket 15% to 25% cap to all its holdings “because a lot depends on the maturity of the asset as well as the opportunity that exists for us to do some monetisation” but it will be actively assessing its portfolio going forward to reap the best possible benefits for Malaysia.Given the current portfolio constraints, Khazanah is looking at achieving 3% returns above inflation over a rolling five-year period, a target that will be relooked over time as the portfolio is reshaped — a journey that Shahril reckons could take seven to 10 years. Khazanah will also be managing costs more tightly. One example is that it did not need to pay investment banking fees for its IHH deal with Mitsui because the capability exists in-house.  For more on what he has to say about Khazanah’s new mandate, read the following interview: The Edge: How have your past six months at Khazanah been? What is your mandate and is it clear? Are your money-making skills going to be put to good use?Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan: When I stepped in at the end of August last year, it was a fairly abrupt shift from my previous position at EPF. But given that the Malaysian market is not that big and EPF and Khazanah have had many dealings in the past, the transition was fairly short. Obviously, I already knew quite a lot of people at Khazanah and we’d done some common investments in the past. Also, we more or less knew what was happening at Khazanah, so I would say it was a fairly steep learning curve in terms of the time that we had. But it was not something that was impossible to do, given that there was a lot of knowledge coming in already.So, the first thing that was quite apparent, that really needed to happen, I think, was to ensure that the new board and new government in place had a clear understanding of what Khazanah’s vision or mandate was going to be. I think, really, that’s the most important thing that needs to be upfront because for any organisation, if you’re not clear about what the expectations are or what the mandate is, it is very hard to work on the policies within the firm to take it forward.So, we worked on that upfront and I think we got a lot of clarity very early on in terms of my discussions with the government and the new board. By December, when we had our formal strategy review as well as our outlook for 2019, we formulated a very clear strategy, which was adopted [approved] by our board, so that’s the new Khazanah mandate.The Khazanah mandate is really twofold. One, Khazanah essentially should function like a traditional sovereign wealth fund for other countries, which is focused on the long-term growth of its assets on behalf of and for the benefit of all Malaysians over generations. So, that’s a much longer-term goal, which is about growth and about making sure that on a risk-adjusted basis, we reach the kind of targets and returns that we set for ourselves. But we also recognise the fact that Khazanah, over the years, has also played a developmental role, that is a strategic role for the government, and that continues as well. And that is focused really on our strategic side, about making the right investments and working with the government on regulations and the environment to make sure that beyond just a commercial objective, those strategic investments also fulfil a role in creating the right atmosphere and right infrastructure for Malaysia’s development and economic growth.When we look at that, essentially we think of Khazanah as having two pools of assets. One pool is focused on the long-term asset growth target. Internally, we call it our commercial fund. The other pool of assets — which focuses on Khazanah’s strategic role of helping develop Malaysia — is our strategic fund. The split between the two pools is roughly 70:30 — 70% is focused on long-term asset growth for Malaysians while 30% is focused on the strategic role that we reinforce. What is the biggest difference between the old and new mandates?It is clarity on Khazanah’s long-term goal and vision. The previous management was very focused on GLC (government-linked company) transformation and Khazanah did a fantastic job of raising the standard of the GLCs it was invested in and championing the regionalisation of Malaysian companies — with a lot of success. And if we look at the last 12 years or so, before I stepped in, it had seen a lot of success in terms of achieving those goals but really, as the organisation matures, you have to move forward because a lot of that work is done. We can’t keep focusing on that work; from the point of view of effort versus returns, most of it has been achieved but you will be on a path of diminishing returns if you keep focusing on the same strategy. I think that’s basically something that Khazanah itself recognises. To be fair, even before I stepped in, they’d already started thinking about taking all these steps, which is why it was quite easy to start the transition. Because really, it is about articulating where we go as an organisation. Khazanah’s pool of assets is fairly limited, at RM100-plus billion, and there is speculation that it will sell a lot of those assets and give the money back to the government. Will Khazanah be given any leeway in keeping some of the funds from monetising its assets and investing that for longer-term growth and returns? Singapore, for instance, has NIRC (net investment return contribution), which contributes about 20% to the government’s budget …One of the things we’ve worked on under the strategy adopted by the board is that when we look at Khazanah’s pool of assets and at our own requirements to restructure and balance the portfolio, we have fairly clear guidelines internally that for every divestment we make, a certain portion goes towards debt repayment, a certain portion towards reinvestment and from a government point of view, we now have a clear dividend policy. Last year, we committed about RM1 billion plus to the government as dividend and that is to be an ongoing and steady dividend policy. RM1 billion (dividend) every year?Roughly RM1 billion a year. If you look at the asset rationalisation that we’ve been doing, a lot of it is towards the fact that as we become a more mature commercial fund, the proceeds from the divestment are used for restructuring the portfolio.There is this misconception that we’re selling because the government needs money. That is not quite true. We are actually doing some disposals to rationalise the portfolio. If you look at our portfolio, quite clearly, there is some imbalance. For instance, we are highly concentrated in terms of our Malaysian exposure. From a more balanced point of view, we really should have more global exposure.Similarly, our concentration in certain companies, we felt basically that the time has come for us to actually look at diversifying our exposure. For instance, we did that IHH Healthcare transaction last year. That is a template for how we basically view the portfolio. When the opportunity arises for us to rationalise or dispose of certain assets, we will only do so if the value is right and the proceeds are used to reinvest and rebalance the portfolio.I think people tend to misunderstand because we (Khazanah) are owned by the government. They seem to think that every time we sell an asset, the proceeds go straight to the government. The proceeds actually stay in Khazanah for the purpose of reinvestment because its longer-term goal is to grow that pool of assets for the benefit of Malaysia as a whole.So, the dividend portion — yes, we have committed to a dividend policy to the government and that is reflected in the government’s budget itself where RM1 billion or so is anticipated from Khazanah on a yearly basis.What we’re trying to do is to give more certainty to what we can deliver for government budgeting purposes. That commitment of about RM1 billion a year is that certainty that we’re giving the government. Is that on an increasing basis, until you can get more? When do you think Khazanah can give more?The plan is that as we restructure the portfolio and it starts to generate the kind of returns we think it should over the long term, that would give us more capacity. At that point, we will look at a higher dividend to the government.But the focus right now is to restructure the portfolio because to have a proper balance between our exposure and the risks we’re taking, a lot of reinvestment needs to be done to restructure the portfolio now. So, there is no rush to sell assets?Not at all. There will come opportunities where it makes sense for us to consider a sale. IHH Healthcare was obviously one of those, where basically we’ve done a lot of work in terms of building up that regional champion and our partner Mitsui is very keen to play a bigger role in the company and we are quite happy to let it do so. So, we remain a partner in the company as well and we will keep working with Mitsui to grow the company. Khazanah was reported to be looking to keep only 15% to 25% stakes in companies and disposing of the rest to raise cash for the nation’s coffers …That story was not directly sourced from us (Khazanah), so there are some accuracy issues. So, there is no 15% to 25% (equity holding) limit? A number of your holdings have breached that level: 66% in UEM Sunrise, 37% in Axiata, 33% in MAHB, 27% in CIMB ...When you look at each of our assets, it is hard to apply a blanket rule like that because a lot depends on the maturity of the asset as well as the opportunity that exists for us to do some monetisation.In some cases, like IHH Healthcare, we would do a partial sale because we still believe in the long-term future of the asset. But like any good portfolio manager, when the opportunity exists for you to take some of your money because you’re clearly sitting on some fairly decent gains, you should exercise the financial discipline to do so and rebalance the portfolio. Otherwise, as the value of the asset keeps growing, it takes up a larger proportion of your total portfolio and from a risk-adjusted basis, it becomes a bit more difficult to justify having so many of your eggs in one basket.There will be opportunities for us to do a total sale — sometimes, if we feel that we’ve brought it as far as we think we can and that it might be better off in somebody else’s hands, and we can get good value for it, then we do a total sale. In some cases, like IHH Healthcare, we do a partial sale. In some instances, we might just continue to hold what we have today if we believe there is better value upside for us in doing so. So, it is not wise to assume that a blanket rule is applied to everything because it doesn’t make sense in a lot of cases. Will Khazanah be initiating more deals [to create/unlock value], such as merging companies or exercises like the airport REIT [which the government announced when tabling Budget 2019]?Depending on the entity and the market it is operating in, there are different opportunities. In some cases, a merger may be the best solution in terms of creating more value for us. In others, it may just be an outright sale. In yet others, it may purely be a focus on organic growth or if we think there are opportunities for us to put more money into the business for it to invest or to grow organically. It is very hard to over-generalise this. You would have seen many different forms in the market, through which value creation can take place. Are you going to merge Axiata with other companies — Telekom or perhaps Astro? Is that being considered or does its current [low] valuation make it very difficult?When we talk about mergers, you also have to be very careful about your own market position. I’m not talking about any company in particular but you have to also look at the fact that mergers sometimes may not be the solution because whenever you do a merger of two entities, you always have the problem of culture and integration. And that’s why from my point of view, you should always look at merger as a solution very, very carefully. Sometimes, those benefits, while they look good on paper, may actually be very difficult to achieve. A lot of the time when you look at a merger as a value creator, you are looking at cost synergies. Invariably, when you look at past mergers, those cost synergies become difficult to achieve because of inherent legacies or inherent problems, so you have to be very careful about pushing mergers as the main form of value creation. So, is there low-hanging fruit that you’re looking to tackle first?Yes, obviously, when we look at the portfolio, there are a number of things that we think we can do in terms of value creation and we will be actively pursuing that throughout the rest of this year. So, yes, there are a few opportunities, I think, but given market sensitivities, we can’t really discuss them in detail but we will make announcements as they come. From your portfolio review, how big a percentage of the assets are ripe for monetisation? Any non-performing assets that Khazanah needs to hive off?Clearly, in any portfolio, you always look at the return at portfolio level, as a whole. Within the portfolio, there are always those that are outperforming and those that are underperforming. So, Khazanah is no different. There are assets, which are clearly not performing to expectation.So, one of the things we hope to instill in Khazanah going forward is a much sharper attitude towards cutting losses early or getting out of situations before they become worse. That’s always one of the fundamental difficulties for any asset manager or portfolio manager, which is that sometimes, you tend to fall in love with the asset or investment. You have got to have more discipline in terms of reducing your losses early and accepting the fact that you can’t win them all. No portfolio manager has 100% success in investment. It is mathematically impossible but the more successful managers have the right culture in place, which allows them to basically identify losers or underperforming assets and make decisions fast enough to redeploy the capital into other assets where you have better opportunities.Similarly here in Khazanah, we are in the midst of looking at those underperforming assets and where we feel there is really no point in continuing — some foreign, some local. Even our global assets, we’ve had some real winners over the last year or so. We had, for instance, our investment in companies like FarFetch and Phunware, which have gone for listing and done well. Similarly, some of those tech investments — there’s always the danger of early-stage investment. You are bound to have some failures, and with those failures, we are just going to draw the line; we’re not going to pump in any more money because there is absolutely no point in good money chasing bad money. One of the assets that need a lot of money is Malaysia Airlines. Is it still going to be on Khazanah’s books?Yes. It is part of our strategic portfolio. In terms of commercial returns, we are encouraging the Malaysia Airlines board and management to close the gap in commercial outcome, but beyond that, Malaysia Airlines, for a very long time, also served a fundamental purpose for the Malaysian economy in terms of being the national carrier and promoting tourism, there are a lot of intangible and commercial benefits, which don’t necessarily accrue to the airline itself but to the country. This is why it sits in our strategic basket.Obviously, I think a lot more can be done to improve the commercial outcome of the airline itself but we have to recognise that there is — at this point in time and for a lot of national airlines around the world — a cost to maintain the benefit to the economy as a whole in terms of linkages and trade and so on. The key here is for the Malaysia Airlines board and management to think through and accept the fact that it is an extremely competitive world out there. They have to find a way to actually compete and do it commercially. Does this mean there could be additional help, apart from the previous plan that was announced?Well, they are in the midst of a review of the strategic plan they’ve in place and quite clearly, there are elements of the strategy that have worked and those that haven’t. What we’re asking them to focus on is that you have to be realistic to see what is working and what is not. For what is not working, you might as well do something different because there is really no point in trying to do the same thing over and over again, if it is really not working.So, we are waiting for them to come back to us. The onus is on the management and board to come back to the shareholders and say, ‘Look, we think this is going to be a more viable strategy’. Then, we will look at it and see whether or not we agree. There is talk that the RM6 billion is not enough and that it is up to the management and board to convince Khazanah that they are worth additional support and money until they make it ...Like I said, we’re waiting for them to come back to us. There is no point in pursuing a course of action that is not going to work in this business climate. If it is obviously not going to work, why do it? So, let’s wait and see.I think there are elements that they are already implementing, which have a better chance of success. They have launched AMAL, which is a specialised service for umrah and haj. That looks decent as a strategy. It plays to one of their competitive strengths. We’re asking them, ‘If you can think of things like AMAL, then surely you can think of strategies for your other businesses that are not performing well and look at doing something different?’ When are they due to come back on the plan?Hopefully, in a very short period of time. The aviation sector has become very complex because of the competition and quite clearly in Malaysia, you have a very clear market leader in low-cost airlines, which is AirAsia. The reality is that AirAsia now dominates that segment. So, the problem we’re facing is that it is very different from 20 years ago, when Malaysia Airlines was a monopoly. That’s not going to happen ever again. There is no point in pining for the good old days. You have to accept reality and move on. You mentioned a 70:30 split and Malaysia Airlines sits in the 30% (strategic) basket. Can we generalise and say that the 30% comprises the not-for-sale assets and whatever is in the 70%, if its potential is maxed out, you will just sell it?Yeah, if you look at it that way. I’ll be very frank with you. The strategic side encompasses TM, Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia Airports, our holdings in Malaysia Airlines, Iskandar, which is a catalytic development down south, and one or two small pieces in there like our tourism and resort business, which again, is a catalytic development for Malaysia in terms of encouraging growth in that area. Really, everything else is in our commercial side. So Axiata, UEM, Astro and CIMB … are in the 70%?Axiata, UEM Group, Astro, CIMB … that’s in our commercial fund. Our view, essentially, is that from a control point of view and from an influence point of view, we will remain focused in our strategic basket because those are the companies that I think makes more sense for us to spend time with [their] board and management in terms of regulatory outcomes because those have a bigger impact on Malaysia’s economy and infrastructure development. For the rest, really, the government has no interest or business influencing or being in control of private hospitals, or a commercial bank or a property development or building services. I think the right path, and our board agrees, is that these are businesses that really do not need government ownership or management. They should really be free to go and do their own thing. We will be purely an investor.As you yourself said, we have to recognise that when the right opportunity comes, we will look at whether we can create value for Khazanah by either disposing, merging or organic growth. So, it is fully a portfolio-based approach to those investments. We have heard the phrase ‘financial discipline’ a few times and you mentioned it alongside ‘loving the asset’ too much. Is that one of the shortcomings you found when you came in?I wouldn’t say it is a shortcoming. I think basically, it is just a natural path. Khazanah for the past 12 years has been focusing on revamping these companies and we’ve done a great job in terms of revamping. When you look at the amount of value created for companies like TM, Tenaga and CIMB over the last 10 to 12 years, it has been fantastic, right?Obviously, as the organisation matures, we have to recognise the fact that we’ve done our part. We now have professional boards, professional management at these companies. The onus now rests on those boards and managements to basically keep that value creation growing. Our role then shifts, as far as those companies are concerned, towards essentially being a capital allocator.If we feel that the nation’s capital, Khazanah’s assets, are best deployed in those companies, they will continue to be deployed in those companies. If there are other opportunities, we will redeploy somewhere else because the main goal of Khazanah going forward is really about long-term growth of our assets. If that long-term growth can be achieved by staying with these companies, fine. If not, we should really have the discipline to say we’ve taken it as far as we can, it’s time to take that money and the profits that we’ve made and redeploy them somewhere else. Is there a cap for Khazanah when it comes to foreign investments?There’s not so much a cap. If you look at our portfolio, we are short on global assets. The reason for that is we’ve always been very mindful … Traditionally, the GLICs [government-linked investment companies] have had an outsized presence in Malaysia, especially on Bursa Malaysia. When Khazanah looks at it, our point of view is basically, we already have EPF and PNB. They are very big local investors and rightly so because on their account are Malaysian holders who are expecting decent ringgit outcomes [returns].If the focus is really on long-term asset growth, then we have to have a more balanced portfolio that looks at both Malaysia as well as globally on the commercial side. The strategic side will always be Malaysia-focused, but on the commercial side, it needs to be more balanced in order to provide the right risk-adjusted returns. What kind of global assets are you looking at?It will be in line with our risk-return profile. The difference from say, the EPF — which has capital stability as one of its core goals and has a fairly large allocation towards debt and fixed income — is that Khazanah’s focus is more on growth. We are much more heavily focused on equities, a mix of both public as well as private equities.Our asset allocation going forward is roughly going to be about 60% public equities, 30% private equities and 10% real assets.The reason for that is we don’t have individual accounts to worry about but we focus more on longer-term growth, so the right measure for a fund like Khazanah — for our commercial fund — is effectively an inflation plus strategy measured over a rolling, say, five-year period. That’s really the focus we are working on and that’s what we’re going with. You say you are going to increase your overseas presence. Where is the ideal threshold?That will come over time. It’s not as easy as saying we’re going to do it because the bulk of our assets are still Malaysia-focused.When I mentioned that we need to rebalance the portfolio, essentially we need to rebalance it towards being more global. IHH Healthcare Bhd is a good example. A large portion of the money from the transaction will go towards our global exposures. We will rebalance gradually over time.We think, honestly, from where our portfolio is and where the markets are, you’re probably looking at a seven to 10-year journey before we actually get to that ideal situation. We are talking about a capital outflow over time?Yeah, very gradual. Over a seven to 10-year period, it’s something that will allow that growth in global assets. So right now, it is like 30%?We are less than that actually, we are only about 15%. So your contract is for five or 10 years?No, CEO contracts should never be that long. My contract is only for three years from Aug 20, 2018. Back to dividends. The number was RM1.5 billion last year and it’s RM1 billion this year. How does Khazanah decide on the amount? Petronas, for instance … there is their net income. If the oil price is above US$70 a barrel, people know Petronas is in a good position to pay more dividends. In Khazanah’s case, how do you assess whether you’re in a position to pay more?As part of our strategic review, we have an internal dividend policy in place and that looks forward for the year. We already know what’s in our pipeline in terms of what we are planning to do or what is already on the way. We have a fairly decent idea of the kind of proceeds we will be generating and a percentage of that will be for dividends. What’s the percentage?It is roughly about 20% of the net proceeds from our transactions and the deals we’ve done. You’re not under pressure from the government to declare higher dividends?To be fair, I think the government understands there is always a trade-off between short-term dividends versus long-term portfolio rebalancing. There is a danger that if you try to extract too much money upfront, it leaves very little money for rebalancing the portfolio and that would then affect the long-term viability of Khazanah and the portfolio itself.So, one of the things that we’ve been very eager to do is have that discussion and emphasise basically the fact that you do need to allow space for that rebalancing, which would then allow you to, in future years, have a better outcome as far as dividends are concerned. Otherwise, what happens when you’re too short-termish and try to extract money from the portfolio, you are basically jeopardising that ultimate objective. The government understands the position?Yes, and that’s why our projected dividends for this year is roughly RM1 billion. The 20% is from disposal, or is it after it is in your books?When we look at net proceeds, obviously we have a cost to run Khazanah as well, so while we focus on the proceeds portion, one of the key objectives that we will be looking at here is also making Khazanah more cost-efficient. When we look at that, we have to benchmark properly against other similar funds. The whole idea is that we should be running at roughly 30 basis points (bps) for AUM (assets under management). We were running at higher than that in the last few years. How much higher?Probably 15bps to 20bps higher. So, one of the key things we are focusing on this year is to drive down running costs. Are you going to shut down some of the regional offices or downsize?Obviously, we are reviewing a lot of our cost structure where it makes sense. It has to be appropriate to our objective as well, what we intend to do in terms of redeployment. So yes, in some instances, we will downsize our operations. That’s only natural. In certain areas, the cost may not justify what we’re trying to achieve. It seems that the prime minister is not so happy that some officers, including those in Khazanah, were being paid at investment banker’s scale. Has there been any feedback from the Prime Minister’s Department on salaries and remuneration?One of the key things when looking at remuneration is the fact that it has got to commensurate with the type of jobs and skills that we want to attract. From my point of view, you also have to be mindful that you’re expecting these people to generate value for you. You have to pay people appropriately.I do agree that, basically, we shouldn’t have excessive remuneration. In any organisation, that just doesn’t make sense, but you need to pay people for the kind of value that they are bringing.Generally, when we look at remuneration, it is in line with the financial industry. So, obviously, if you compare it to maybe a pure government-type agency, it would not be like that. But the whole idea is if you’re expecting people from investment banking or asset management to join you, then you have to basically provide them with a commensurating financial package. Otherwise, you’re not going to get them. It is the same for all fund managers, whether it is Khazanah, EPF and PNB. You are competing for a talent pool that is essentially mobile and that can go work in any investment bank or asset management house.The key difference with an entity like Khazanah is that we also have the element of national pride and national duty. So that helps, I think, in attracting a different kind of talent, those who wants to contribute to the country, who may not be focusing on remuneration as the No 1 objective. But to be fair to these people, you still have to pay them. You may not pay them at the top quartile of the financial industry but you’ve got to pay them at the average for them to come in. Did you have to take a pay cut to come in or are they banking on your love for country?Let’s put it this way lah, I’ve been doing national service for the last don’t know how many years now and I personally quite enjoy working and contributing towards this kind of organisation. So I’m one of those guys who have never been particularly motivated by remuneration. You’ve been here six months. Where is the fat in terms of cost?When you look at cost as a whole, there are elements where quite clearly, you can do a lot better. To be fair to the team here, they’ve already initiated those measures in the past. We are in the midst of doing full cost review. We think we can get to about 35bps this year. Is that coming from people or more [closing] offices?It’s a combination of a number of things. Some of it is fixed cost, office cost as well as infrastructure or system cost. Second is basically variable cost or deal cost. There we just need to be smarter about how we execute deals in order to reduce cost. IHH is a prime example. For the IHH transaction, everything was effectively in-house. So, we effectively didn’t have to pay investment bankers to do the deal. That capability does exist.Coming back to the issue of remuneration, it’s basically a balance between paying the right price to get the right people on board and then making sure that those people deliver value. In this case, the team basically in-housed the whole transaction, [the deal was done] without having to pay unnecessary investment banking fees. An early statement from Tun Mahathir, when the new government took over, was that Khazanah has veered away from its original objective. Have you had a chance to meet with the prime minister to clarify?Of course, he is the chairman of the board. He is fully involved in the discussion on the approval of the new strategy by the board. To be fair to him, he is correct. The Khazanah that was set up in the 1990s was a very different animal — it was effectively a holding company, holding shares for the government. But over the course of time, like all organisations, those objectives change over time.In the 2000s right to the time I took over, that objective then became about enhancing the value of those assets, instead of being just a passive holder of those assets. It became more active in actually creating value by getting the right values, right systems, into those companies, and that has been a success. And the government has actually benefited from that. The government has actually reaped the value increase of companies like TM, Tenaga, CIMB and the rest.Now, the new strategy reflects what Khazanah will become over the next few years. Khazanah has changed and, like all organisations, will continue to change as we develop and mature. From the earlier statements, it seems that the prime minister wanted Khazanah to change back to its original purpose. Was that the indication?The government has basically approved the strategy, the board has approved the strategy. That’s a reflection that Khazanah has got this new mandate and vision. We will execute this new mandate and vision. This vision is different from what it was two years ago, it is different from what it was 20 years ago, but I think it is the right vision and mandate for what Khazanah should be going forward for the country. One of the largest impediments for Khazanah is the limited fund size of less than RM200 billion. When it is split to 60:30:10, the pool is even smaller and you already have a basket of things that you can’t really move. Are you using these three years to expand the pool? Is there a chance of getting more from the government by saying, we can get this much returns, give us the money?One of the natural constraints, as you rightly pointed out, is unlike the more traditional sovereign wealth funds, we don’t have a ready pool of AUM [funds] coming into Khazanah. That’s why Khazanah, especially in the last 10 years, has grown through using some debt to fund new purchases and organically growing the value of those assets. That was the strategy that was put in place.Going forward, we recognise the fact that government finances are currently a bit constrained. They are doing some restructuring of their finances. To expect the government to be able to commit new assets over the short-term would be difficult but obviously, as we put this [new] strategy in place, over the long term, we will be working with the government to see whether there are opportunities for us to manage more assets. But that is something that is not a short-term priority. Short-term priority really is the portfolio rebalancing and restructuring and we will move forward with that first. On your new mandate, [one newswire] had the headline “More cash less control”.More cash is generally a bad idea because cash gives you little returns. So while it is a catchy headline, it is very bad from an investment point of view, unless you’re willing to have a large cash drag on your portfolio.We basically have two clear mandates. One is on the commercial side, which is on the bulk of our assets — it is really about long-term, inflation-adjusted growth for the country and that’s focused on delivering long-term asset growth for the nation.On the strategic side … while focusing on commercial returns, it is [also] making sure that those assets continue to perform their role of strategically of helping the country to grow the economy as well as providing the right regulatory environment for other players to participate and compete. In terms of cutting losses, do you find it easier to do in EPF or Khazanah?The asset mixes and the concentration risks are very different. The EPF has been operating as a portfolio investor for a very long time. It is actually easier for them [EPF] because concentration are very small, amounts may be big, but concentration as a percentage of the entity is very small.For Khazanah, because a lot of our assets are sticky or lumpy, even if you wanted to dispose, it is normally a much longer process because we have a lot more liquidity constraints, for instance. Given how much share prices have come down, and you need to raise cash to do some of the portfolio restructuring, are you thinking [along the lines] of, say, a share-backed exchangeable bond?Financial markets are very sophisticated now, there are many different ways we can monetise or generate the kind of liquidity that we need. We’re actually quite comfortable with where it is. Markets have come down and there is a significant loss in value, especially over the last one year, in a number of our core asset holdings for various reasons, sometimes due to very significant regulatory change, like in the case for TM, where values today basically reflect a very different regulatory and operating environment. So, when we look at the portfolio as a whole, there are some areas where we obviously have more leeway or latitude to try and do things. In some areas, a bit more constrained. We have to accept that. That’s why it is important to have a diversified portfolio, because that gives you more ability to adjust for market conditions. When a portfolio is overly concentrated, then you are a hostage to both the market as well as the operating environment. It sounds like you’re reshaping Khazanah to be a portfolio investor. How do you rank this particular challenge compared to previous challenges in your previous roles?Like I said, every role has different challenges. Here, I think the challenge is not so much one of size. Yes, size is a constraint. Actually, the biggest constraint is more liquidity and concentration of risk. That’s actually the biggest challenge. Not so much size.And that is something which has to be addressed carefully because obviously, when you are the largest shareholder of an entity, any move that you make can be counterproductive to your value. And therefore, you have to do transactions or investments in a way which basically makes sense to your holdings as a whole.IHH is a classic example. Before we did the IHH transaction, the IHH share price was languishing, due to various reasons, at a fairly low level. But as soon as we made that transaction, it was very clear to the market that it was one transaction we were going to do ... the share overhang disappeared, the transaction itself set a new benchmark in terms of where the market perceived value of IHH and the share price then rerated, which benefited the balance holdings that we have as well.So you have to be careful, I think, in structuring this kind of transaction to make sure that you’re not shooting yourself in the foot. So you’ll be looking for people or investors or strategic partners that would recognise value in your assets, right?Obviously. Because I think if you adopt a strategy of just trying to dispose into the market, one, you create a massive share overhang, especially given the fact that in some of these companies, you are the largest shareholder. If we try to do a market disposal, once we just signal the intention into the market that you are a seller, suddenly people look at the shares and say no point buying, there’s a giant block of shares waiting to come into the market.So, in some instances, you just have to be patient, you find the right deal, and then that right deal essentially addresses the share overhang issue, addresses the market valuation issue at the same time, and gives you basically the ability to monetise a portion. Do you have another partner [like Mitsui for IHH] for your other assets?Not at this time. Obviously, there are things we are looking at and some discussions we are having but like I said, we’ll make announcements as it happens. Some news reports mentioned Japanese money coming into Khazanah.I think maybe they drew from the fact that Mitsui had come in for IHH and kind of extended that line a bit further maybe. When you say inflation-adjusted growth, would it be the country’s projected GDP growth for a particular year plus inflation?What we’re looking at is basically average inflation over a rolling five year period plus 3%. That seems conservative [low] for a fund that’s focused on growthIt reflects the fact that our current portfolio is constrained in terms of what we can do. So over time, as the portfolio is reshaped, those targets would be reviewed and relooked at again. Otherwise, there is no point in setting an unachievable or unrealistic target.We have to be a realist. We have to work within the constraint of the portfolio today. Inflation plus 3%, I think, is a reasonable and achievable target, without necessitating us to take unnecessary risk, given the fact that we have constraints on how much we can actually move the portfolio at this point. As you rebalance your portfolio, will the Bumiputera equity factor be one that will shape that rebalancing process?There are always going to be opportunities for entrepreneurs or management teams to look at being part of the process. Khazanah has done that in the past as well, with Time dotCom and other companies. So we will always look at that as well. Part of the vision of Khazanah, in terms of national development as a whole is how we create the right entrepreneur class to participate in the economy. There will be opportunities but it would be dependent on what type of asset it is. Something that is very big, like an IHH, that’s going to be more difficult because that’s much more of an institutional-type asset. But I guess there are smaller pieces in our portfolio which may be sole businesses or solo line businesses, which we will give opportunities for entrepreneurs or maybe the management team to propose a buyout of those assets. Your 60:30:10, that’s the target in seven to 10 years. What does it look like now?Right now it’s very much public markets but within the public markets, it is very concentrated because the bulk of our assets are reflected in under 10 companies. So that’s why transactions like IHH are important. It allows us to derisk our portfolio a bit by taking some of the AUM out of a single company and reinvesting in a broader spectrum of stuff. So the whole idea, over the seven to 10 years, we need to restructure and do something that makes more sense in terms of achieving the objective. The private equity part will be the 30%. What is it now?10% or so. Real assets?Real assets are very small, about 5%. Will you be looking at more real estate deals, when you talk about real assets? Is that going to be faster or longer-term when you get more assets to manage from the government?No. As part of the portfolio restructuring, we will start to deploy money in the different areas. Certainly, over time, we will see a shift in that portfolio… Do you count PLUS as a real asset?PLUS is more of an infrastructure asset. It is kind of a hybrid, it sits somewhere between our private equity and real assets basket. Would you say Khazanah internally is well-equipped for a much heavier foreign presence in terms of investments?We have many good people here who are very focused on the investment part. We will do a bit of supplementing on that because, quite clearly, as we build capacity in things like public markets, we will build capacity there as well. We are pretty okay. You come from EPF, which has RM800 billion and now you have a portfolio constraint. Would you count this as your toughest job ever [to date]?Every job has its own challenges. So, obviously, managing RM800 billion has its own challenges, where do you find enough investments to fill that entire pot and do it in a way that you’re still managing risk and generating the right returns.Here, it is a slightly different challenge. The biggest challenge to Khazanah at this point in time is how do we restructure and rebalance the portfolio while maintaining financial discipline in terms of making sure we get the right value for any divestment that we do and at the same time, recognising the fact that we have to be faster in either cutting losses out or disposing non-viable assets.Skill-set wise, it is transferable. It is the same philosophies in terms of trying to make sure that people understand that risk and return needs to be managed.That is why the first real thing that we needed to do here is clearly understand what is the right vision and mandate moving forward. Once that is set, then you can work on other things, what is your risk appetite, what is your philosophy, what is the asset allocation strategies because all that flows from that part. And that part really is about crystallising the idea that Khazanah really has two mandates, and these two mandates require separate consideration about what’s right and suitable. Last year, during the annual review, Khazanah said you have a China portfolio and that made quite a bit of money. Are you going to dedicate more funds into something like that?China, for instance, has been a big success for us. What is more important going forward is understanding how that fits into the overall larger portfolio, making sure that we have the right risk-return on the portfolio as a whole and within the individual portfolio is making sure that we are not overly weighted on tech and venture cap versus, say, consumers, versus financials … The whole idea is that when you start to think through these issues, you want to achieve a better overall portfolio return for the amount of risk we are taking. How’s the staff morale since the change of guard?Well, obviously, as in any organisation, when you have a sudden change of leadership, there’s always going to be anxiety as well as uncertainty over what’s going to happen.Hopefully, I think with the new strategy in place, the board approvals have all been done and the fact that everybody in there is now working towards a strategy, at least the uncertainty as to where the firm is heading has been resolved. But like in any change of strategy, there is going to be some anxiety about whether the individuals themselves are capable of executing that strategy. But that’s something you can actually work on over time, so we’re just like, all the strategic changes that I’ve put into place, you have to focus on making sure that you’re also focused on the human capital part and the development part to make sure that people understand their role in the new strategy. What was the first thing that your chairman said to you in the first meeting?He just wanted assurance that I would be able to deliver, in terms of success, for Khazanah in the same way that I’ve done in the past for, say, EPF, in making sure that we can actually create the right strategy for the organisation, which will then deliver success for the organisation.So, really, I think more along the lines of just getting assurance that the right strategy will be thought of and that management will be redirected in the right way. So I think, that’s the first part, which is basically, management and board on the same page as to where the firm should be going.And that’s been done, so now I think there’s no more uncertainty or lack of clarity as to where the firm should be headed. It’s now all about execution. So, given that the airport REIT was announced in the budget, is that the first big deal happening this year?No, actually, on the airport side, I think — and this is something that you really have to discuss with Malaysia Airports more — but I would imagine that their focus really is on resolving the regulatory framework first.Because without a clear regulatory framework in place, you can’t actually do any kind of asset monetisation because investors coming in want to have certainty about what their returns are going to be like. So that needs to happen first. TM is in your strategic portfolio. Have you got clarity on what the government actually wants to do?Yes. TM and the ministry, I think, have been sitting down a lot to really narrow the gap on expectations and in terms of where the regulatory framework is going to go.As a shareholder, we will also engage with the ministry to make sure that they understand and appreciate the fact that for the right investment to happen in any industry, whether it’s telco or anything else, you need to have clarity on your regulatory side because investors need to know how much you’re going to make from the investments that you’re putting in.And if the regulations or regulatory framework is not conducive, then nobody’s going to fund anymore expansion, because from a calculation point of view, why would I fund a billion ringgit of capital into that industry if I’m not going to get the same kind of return as I would expect putting it somewhere else. So you’re not expected to do national service in terms of TM?No, you have to be very careful about that because I think these are all public-listed companies and there’s a very big market implication, as you’ve seen with TM, if investors lose confidence in the regulatory framework. And then what will happen is it becomes very hard to raise new money for the industry. Has this been communicated to the respective ministries?Yes, I think that ongoing engagement is happening all the time and, to be fair, obviously government will have its own policy objectives. I think the job of the companies operating in those spaces is to properly advise the regulators on what are the financial or market implications of the various options that they’re looking at.Ultimately, it rests with the government. And if the government decides that it wants to implement a particular policy direction, it’s really their prerogative, but they need to do so, I think, in full knowledge of all the financial and market implications.Ultimately, the regulators have the right to set a policy direction. But they need to be very aware of the implications. So, what can the market expect from Khazanah this year? Because when you announce last year’s results (on Feb 28), the numbers are probably not going to look so good.Yes we’re planning to do our annual announcement, probably at the end of the month or so, and generally speaking … the market’s been performing very badly and some of our companies, TM in particular, and Axiata, for instance, and the telco industry as a whole have been very badly hit by regulatory uncertainty. So that, of course, will have a very big negative impact on results, clearly, because the market itself was difficult last year. The number of transactions that Khazanah could execute last year was also very limited.So you’ll probably not see a great result from Khazanah, and you’re going to have to accept that it’s just market reality. But the whole point, I think, is that we’ll refocus on the rebalancing and the portfolio reconstruction and we’ll be looking forward to see what we can do. So we accept that 2018 was a difficult year and that’s only natural.One of the things that you probably know from my time at EPF is that I’m perfectly happy to be as transparent as possible on financial numbers and results. So, when the time comes at the end of the month, we’ll be as transparent as we can, and in terms of the results, it is what it is. M+S, what is the latest news?As you would have seen from various news reports, M+S is engaging in a process on its Duo assets and that process is ongoing right now, so I’m not really at liberty to talk too much about what’s happening in that process, but effectively if that process concludes, they’ll make the right announcements. Sounds like all possibilities are still relatively open for Malaysia Airlines if they can come up with a plan that convinces Khazanah. But if they continue to struggle, like you said a lot of national carriers are struggling around the world, if they continue to struggle and cannot find the right plan, can or will Khazanah eventually draw a line somewhere?Well, ultimately, I think the right question to ask — and this ultimately is a policy decision that will be made by the government — is how valuable are the intangible benefits that a national airline provides to the country. And to what extent are you willing to keep investing in a company to enjoy those intangible benefits, even the company itself, the airline itself may not enjoy the commercial benefits.Because the reality is that for every dollar of tourist spend or business spend that Malaysia Airlines can bring into the country, that’s a dollar for the country but not necessarily a benefit for the airline itself. So there’s a multiplier of roughly eight to 10 times in terms of spend to the country. The issue for the government, at some point, will be to ask that question. So the government has to decide lah.Yes, ultimately it’s a question that the government has to decide because that affects the commitment of Khazanah towards the airline itself. If we only take one thing away from this interview, what should it be?Essentially, if we execute the [new] strategy correctly, then Khazanah really will become that guardian of the nation’s wealth and would be the guardian in terms of that future growth. And that’s important because I think what the country needs is basically a pool of assets that is focused on long-term growth, because over time, you need that pool of assets to contribute back to the national budget in a way that will help to relieve the pressure on other sources of income.Otherwise the country as a whole, our national budget, is overly dependent on just a few sources of income. You pointed out the Singapore example and that’s correct, you should have more diversification [on the sources of income] on the national budget. How long before Khazanah can play that role?The way I look at the portfolio today, it’s easily about seven to 10 years to fully restructure. But this has always been a long-term goal. Most sovereign wealth funds think about 30 years as their time horizon, and that’s why, like I said, what is the right balance or trade-off between short-term cash requirements versus a long-term generation of growth. I think that’s something that needs to be balanced.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-man-mandate

(Feb 27, RM2.96)
Maintain trading buy with a target price (TP) of RM3.60: Telekom Malaysia (TM) reported a net profit of RM69.7 million in fourth quarter financial year 2018 (4QFY18), recovering from a loss of RM175.6 million in 3QFY18 that was mainly due to an impairment loss relating to its wireless and fixed network assets.For the current quarter, there was an additional impairment of RM48 million. Stripping out this and other non-operating items, normalised 4QFY18 net profit fell 53% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM104.9 million following the implementation of the mandatory standard of access pricing (MSAP).For full-year FY18, normalised net profit of RM632.4 million (-26.7% y-o-y) was within our expectation but slightly above market estimates of RM598.5 million.Our FY19 to FY20 forecast earnings estimates are increased marginally by 1% to 2% due to housekeeping changes. TM declared a two sen cash dividend, which works out to be about 50% of normalised net profit, in line with the management’s guidance of 40% to 60%.The group’s FY18 revenue was down 3.5% y-o-y due to lower contribution from data, Internet and multimedia as well as non-telecommunication-related services. Data revenue fell 7.1% y-o-y to RM664 million due to the implementation of MSAP while other revenue dropped 7.9% y-o-y to RM614 million on lower property contribution and lower tuition fees. Average revenue per user for unifi was lower at RM184 compared with RM197 in 4QFY17. Meanwhile, the subscriber base increased 15.3% y-o-y to 1,298,000.Also, the normalised net profit dropped 53% y-o-y due to the impact of MSAP on wholesale pricing, of which TM has recognised a provision of RM36.8 million (FY18: RM169.2 million).As for provision on impairment of fixed and wireless network assets, an additional sum of RM48 million was recognised in the current quarter (FY18: RM982.5 million). Note that these provisions have narrowed in 4QFY18.For 2019, we believe there will be no further pressure on broadband pricing as the communications and multimedia ministry has indicated its satisfaction of the price cut that took place in 2018. Therefore, we expect TM’s wholesale income to stabilise in FY19F, following the sharp decline in FY18.TM intends to dispose of two office towers (20-storey and 33-storey) that have a combined gross floor area of 679,015 sq ft in Pantai Baru, Kuala Lumpur.Assuming a selling consideration of RM1,100 per sq ft (psf) to RM1,200 psf, which is based on the market value of commercial properties in the surrounding areas, the sale of these towers could potentially raise RM747 million to RM815 million for the group.Based on our estimate, this would help reduce its gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation from 2.4 times to 2.2 times.Nevertheless, given the oversupply condition in Kuala Lumpur’s property market, we opine that it will be a challenge for TM to dispose of these properties at market value. We note that the 20-storey tower was purchased in 2005 at RM65.8 million. — PublicInvest Research, Feb 27",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/intended-sale-two-office-towers-seen-cut-down-tms-debt

They want better services, with lower prices,” acting group chief executive officer Imri Mokhtar told reporters at the group’s FY18 results briefing yesterday.“So TM needs to go beyond just providing connectivity; we need to bring solutions, enabling more digital businesses. To do that, our investment will continue, and invest into digital infrastructure, not just network infrastructure,” he added.Imri said TM’s capital expenditure for FY19 will be 18% to 20% of the group’s total revenue, and will have a balanced investment into enhancing connectivity and digital infrastructure.“In the short term, for us, is to continue our investment while managing our cost, so we can still invest despite many challenges,” he said, adding that TM’s cost optimisation initiatives are expected to increase earnings before interest and tax (Ebit).“Most of the cost savings will be coming from our business operations, across all segments, be it Unifi or TM One, as we simplify business processes. The operation will become leaner,” he said.Therefore, Imri said TM expects Ebit in FY19 to be higher, but declined to provide guidance on the expected quantum of improvement. TM’s Ebit for FY18 fell 94.1% to RM64.6 million, from RM1.09 billion in FY17. 4Q profit slumps 75% as the group ‘took a big hit’ in 2018The group’s net profit for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 (4QFY18) slumped 74.9% to RM69.66 million from RM277.01 million a year ago, as higher finance cost and lower foreign exchange gain on the group’s borrowings, besides higher tax charges, impact earnings.Revenue was also lower by 3.5% at RM3.09 billion, versus RM3.2 billion in 4QFY17.TM group chief financial officer Nor Fadhilah Mohd Ali said out of the group’s RM8.57 billion borrowings as at 4QFY18, 18% or RM1.54 billion of them were US dollar-denominated.He said the group hedged RM200 million of these US dollar-denominated borrowings, while the remaining were under natural hedge against TM’s US dollar revenue.For the full FY18, TM’s net profit dropped 83.5% to RM153.15 million from RM929.75 million a year ago, while revenue declined 2.2% to RM11.82 billion from RM12.09 billion.Imri, who is also TM chief operating officer, said 2018 was one of the most challenging times the group had ever faced, and that it “took a big hit” that year.Last year was the start of the implementation of the Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP), which resulted in lower wholesale network pricing. This allowed Internet service providers in the industry to lower their retail pricing to compete for higher market share.Nevertheless, Imri said the impact of the MSAP’s implementation has been cushioned somewhat by increasing Unifi subscription, as TM also lowered its Unifi entry prices and increase Internet speed in its retail offerings to keep up with the competition.“Also do remember that TM is not just [serving] broadband from home and SME (small and medium enterprises) customers, we [also] serve other customer segments too. Through TM One, we serve enterprise and public sector customers, and [through] TM Global [we serve] domestic and international telcos,” he said.In 4QFY18, TM’s fixed broadband customer base declined 4.2% to 2.23 million customers from 2.33 million customers a year ago, as the increase in Unifi subscribers was not sufficient to offset the amount of customers it lost in other broadband services.The average revenue per user (Arpu) for Unifi also fell 6.6% to RM184 in 4QFY18, from RM197 in the year-ago quarter, while Arpu for other broadband services declined 2.2% to RM88 from RM90.An analyst told The Edge Financial Daily that TM is expected to face the full impact from MSAP in stages.“This [quarter] is not the full impact yet, because there is limited amount of upgrade TM can do for its customers every month, and there is still a substantial amount of people who have not upgraded their package,” he said over the phone.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tm-issues-revenue-warning-fy19

He guided that TM's FY19 capex will be 18% to 20% of the group's total revenue and will have a balanced investment into enhancing connectivity and digital infrastructure.For FY18, Imri said TM spent RM2.1 billion on capex.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tm-expects-lower-fy19-revenue-amid-tougher-industry-landscape

The group declared an interim dividend of two sen per share, with an EX-date of March 14, to be paid on April 12.In a stock exchange filing today, TM said the lower profitability was due to higher finance cost and lower foreign exchange gain on the group’s borrowings, as well as tax charges. Revenue was also 3.5% lower at RM3.09 billion, compared with RM3.2 billion a year ago.For the full FY18, TM’s net profit fell 83.5% to RM153.15 million from RM929.75 million in FY17, while revenue declined 2.2% to RM11.82 billion from RM12.09 billion. EPS fell to 4.08 sen, from 24.74 sen previously.TM said its full year revenue was affected by lower revenue from voice, data and non-telecommunication related services. “Data service was affected by the provision made on estimated impact of regulatory mandated access pricing,” it said.TM said 2018 has been a challenging year for the industry and the group expects the environment to remain challenging and impact its business operations.“TM will accelerate Convergence and empower Digital in line with its transformation that reinforces Customer Centricity.“The transformation plan will be anchored on the Performance Improvement Program 2019-2021 and will focus on bringing a convergence digital lifestyle to all Malaysians and on enabling enterprise and public sector industry verticals to realise their full digital potential whilst being the industry backbone, connecting Malaysia to the world,” it said.TM said total capital expenditure (capex) investment for 2018 was RM2.14 billion, or 18.1% of revenue, which was lower than TM’s full year capex guidance of 19%-20% of revenue. By asset type, access comprised 57.4% of total spending, followed by core network at 17.8% and the remaining 24.8% was for support systems. In 2018, investments were focused on expanding connectivity via deployment of broadband ports and mobile coverage, as well as on digital infrastructure for ICT, data centre, cloud and smart solutions, it said.“2018 was undoubtedly one of the most challenging times TM has ever faced. We worked tirelessly to address the competitive landscape and industry dynamics, without losing focus on our strategies and organisational mission. We took a big hit but this has only strengthened our resolve to make good on what we need to deliver to all our stakeholders,"" said Imri.“We are continuing on our next phase of transformation via the Performance Improvement Programme 2019-2021(PIP2019-2021) to ensure our resilience and long-term sustainability towards shaping a 'New TM' that reinforces customer centricity.“The 'New TM' does not mean that we are going to emerge as something totally 'different'. The 'New TM' is TM as you have always known it, in an enhanced state,” he said.In transforming to become the ""New TM” by 2021, Imri said TM will “incrementally and continuously” improve on doing things in a new and simpler way, in order to serve customers better.“We will be here for our customers as a one-stop shop, enabling them to access our multitude of offerings and effortless support to fulfil all of their digital lifestyle needs. We will also work towards futureproofing our people through capability-building, future-skilling and new ways of working,” he said.“On the customer front, we are able to serve our customers better across products from end-to-end with our converged networks of fixed and wireless; connected seamlessly with ICT infrastructure and digital platforms,” he added.In the meantime, Imri said TM will continue sweating its assets to optimise performance and achieve better focus through convergence.“We will leverage on connectivity to defend and grow our core business and partnership ecosystems to explore new businesses. We will also prudently manage our costs to deliver better value for investors, shareholders and stakeholders,” he added. At 2.56pm, TM shares were down 3 sen or 0.98% to trade at RM3.02, after 2.36 million shares were traded.

The onus is on the management and board to come back to the shareholders and say, ‘Look, we think this is going to be a more viable strategy going forward,’ then we will look at it and see whether we agree or not.”Shahril noted that Malaysia Airlines’ management is in the midst of reviewing its strategic plan and will provide the feedback to Khazanah “hopefully in a very short period of time”.The national sovereign fund, which took Malaysia Airlines private in 2014, has injected RM6 billion into the business in an effort to revive the national carrier.Last September, Malaysia Airlines told The Edge Malaysia weekly that more than half of the RM6 billion funds for its turnaround attempt had been used.The company blamed the weak ringgit and rising jet fuel costs that had derailed its turnover plan, causing it to miss two profitability deadlines since the initial plan was set to make money by 2017.More than RM1 billion dividend from Khazanah in 2019Shahril commented that Khazanah would declare more than RM1 billion of dividend to the government in 2019, adding that its commitment to delivering steady dividends to the nation’s coffer remains intact.“If you look at the budget, they [the government] assumed roughly RM1 billion plus [from Khazanah],” said Shahril.At over RM1 billion, it would be around the same as what Khazanah declared for the government in 2017, when Khazanah announced that the value of its investments climbed for the first time in three years, hitting an all-time high of RM115.6 billion, boosted by surging stock prices at home and abroad.In December last year, Khazanah divested a 16% stake or 1.4 billion shares in IHH Healthcare Bhd to Mitsui & Co Ltd for RM8.42 billion or RM6 a share, citing the divestment formed an important part of the restructuring of its portfolio, and the proceeds raised would be utilised for new investments and capital requirements.Besides IHH Healthcare, Khazanah’s core investments in the listed companies include CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd and UEM Sunrise Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, UEM Edgenta Bhd and Time dotCom Bhd.For more details on what Shahril has said on plans that are in store for Khazanah and companies in its portfolio, pick up the latest issue of The Edge Malaysia weekly.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysia-airlines-needs-good-proposal-more-funding

His current tenure as TNB chairman will come to an end next month.It is interesting that the new Pakatan Harapan government is retaining Moggie as TNB chairman, given the wave of changes seen in the leadership of some government-linked companies following the 14th general election (GE14). Some prominent figures who have either resigned or been removed from their positions include Telekom Malaysia Bhd’s Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazalli Ramly and Tan Sri Habibul Rahman, who was on the board of Malaysia Airlines.Last year, TNB also saw two of its directors — Datuk Abdul Manad Hashim and Datuk Sakthivel Alagappan — choosing not to seek re-election during the group’s annual general meeting as the two felt they might be seen as politically linked.Moggie, 77, himself is keeping mum over his extension. He declined to comment when asked about the matter during TNB’s Chinese New Year celebration last Thursday.Prior to his appointment as TNB chairman, Moggie was an elected member of parliament for Kanowit between 1974 and 2004. Among some of the positions he has held include: energy, communications and multimedia minister (1998 to 2004), works minister (1989 to 1995), and energy, telecommunications and posts minister (1978 to 1989 and 1995 to 1998).He first rose to prominence during Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s first 22-year stint as the country’s prime minister in the 1980s. Last July, Dr Mahathir attended Moggie’s grandchild’s wedding in Sarawak during his first official visit to the state following his return to power as the country’s seventh prime minister.Khazanah Nasional Bhd is the largest shareholder of TNB with a 28.8% stake, followed by the Employees Provident Fund with 13.2%, according to Bloomberg data.In return to queries from The Edge Financial Daily, a spokesman for MoF Inc said there is no statement regarding Moggie’s extension as at press time. An officer at the Prime Minister’s Office also said they are not aware of the matter. Khazanah, when contacted, declined to comment. TNB, meanwhile, said they are unaware of the chairman’s future and that any announcements pertaining to that will be filed with Bursa Malaysia.It is worth noting that TNB’s share price was trading at RM16.06 prior to GE14 but has since fallen by 18.8% to close at RM13.04 last Friday.

"February 11, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TM,"EPF dividend of 5% possible, 6% may be difficult","THE Employees Provident Fund (EPF) is set to declare its annual dividend for 2018 anytime now and anyone who has been paying any attention would know that the odds of it outperforming that in 2017 are low.Not only was last year’s EPF dividend the highest payout in 21 years, nearly every major asset class globally — from stocks and bonds to crude oil and bitcoin — had little or negative returns for 2018. Even so-called havens such as gold and US Treasuries did not do that great year on year.Blaming the US Federal Reserve’s accelerated monetary policy tightening, some fund managers have reportedly lamented how the broad pullback was worse than the rout in 2008 and a stark contrast to the rally in 2017.In 2018, the MSCI World Index was down 8.2% (+23.07% in 2017), the MSCI World High Dividend Yield Index was down 6.7% (+19.17% in 2017), the MSCI Emerging Markets Index tumbled 14.3% (+37.75% in 2017) and the MSCI ACWI — which includes developed and emerging market countries such as China, India, Korea, Brazil and Russia — lost 8.93% after gaining 24.62% the year before.Malaysian equities were not spared. The bellwether FBM KLCI closed 2018 nearly 6% lower while the broader FBM Emas skidded close to 11% last year.Yet, some have seen it fit to blame the EPF’s likely lower year-on-year dividend rate for 2018 on local politics, not unlike how there were curious claims of a correlation between who the incumbent prime minister was and the high EPF dividends in 2017.Let’s set politics aside and take a more objective look at the investment numbers that the EPF has announced so far to see if its dividend rate for 2018 will be close to 5% or 6%.
 The EPF’s past showingFor the record, the EPF’s 6.9% dividend for 2017 was the highest since the 7.7% dividend declared for 1996, the year before the Asian financial crisis. The 6.4% maiden dividend declared for its Simpanan Shariah portfolio for 2017 was also 2.61% above the inflation rate of 3.79% last year.The EPF, which needs to generate consistent and sustainable returns to preserve its 14 million members’ retirement kitty, only needs to deliver at least 2.5% nominal dividend and beat inflation by at least 2% on a rolling three-year basis.The EPF’s fund size is also a growing challenge. Members’ savings have grown an average of 10.98% a year since 1990 to reach RM768.51 billion as at end-2017 (RM700.75 billion conventional and RM67.76 billion under Simpanan Shariah). As at end-September last year, accumulated contributions reached RM785.59 billion for its 14.1 million member base, of which 7.2 million were active (contributing).Between 2007 and 2017, dividends declared by the EPF had been trending upwards except for 2008, 2015 and 2016, the years when the local stock market fell.In 2008, the year the FBM KLCI fell a whopping 38.9%, the EPF’s dividend saw the largest year-on-year decline of 130 basis points from 5.8% in 2007 to 4.5% in 2008.Nonetheless, it is worth noting that one of the largest year-on-year gains in the provident fund’s dividend rate — a 115-basis-point jump — was recorded in 2009 (5.65% dividend rate) while 2017 saw a 120-basis-point jump to 6.9% from 5.7% in 2016.
 Growing burden of every 1% dividendTo pay 2017’s dividend last year, the EPF needed a total of RM48.13 billion, or RM7.02 billion to pay every 1% dividend for its conventional and shariah-compliant portfolios. The 2018 dividend for Simpanan Shariah would only be its second, having paid a total of RM3.98 billion or a 6.4% rate last year.For the conventional portion alone, the EPF needed RM44.15 billion, or RM6.4 billion for every 1% of the 6.9% dividend rate last year. The amount that it needs to pay 1% of dividend has grown at a 10-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.26% — the EPF needed only RM2.89 billion to pay 1% of dividend in 2007.That means the EPF could need at least RM7 billion to pay 1% of dividend for its conventional portfolio this year — that’s not counting the additional money it needs to pay returns for members with the shariah portfolio. The shariah portion would change the 10-year CAGR to 9.27% and bring the amount needed to cover 1% of dividend closer to RM7.7 billion, back-of-the-envelope calculations show.Put another way, the EPF will likely need to have RM35 billion to RM40 billion to pay a 5% dividend for 2018.For a 6% dividend, the EPF would probably need to have made RM42 billion to RM46 billion last year — which means a 6% dividend for 2018 is a tall order in a tough year. Even if the figure is likely lower year on year, the returns are still no small feat for a fund like the EPF, which cannot take on too much risk due to the need to preserve capital.
 Did it make enough for a 6% dividend?For 2017, the EPF’s gross investment income stood at RM48.54 billion (conventional) and RM4.6 billion (shariah), which adds up to RM53.14 billion.According to the EPF’s unaudited figures for the first nine months of 2018, its quarterly investment income was higher year on year, with investment income at RM12.88 billion (1Q2018), RM12.39 billion (2Q2018) and RM14.61 billion (3Q2018), bringing the unaudited total to just under RM40 billion, which may well be subject to adjustments and write-downs, if any, in the final quarter.That means a 5% dividend should be possible, even if the fourth-quarter income is a lot smaller. The wild card, of course, is the impact of potential write-downs.Fourth-quarter figures had not been released at press time and may only be out in April when its annual report is released but the dividend rate is likely to be declared anytime this month. Ten of its past 13 annual dividend announcements have been in February, with the exceptions being in 2008 and 2009 when the rate was announced by mid-March. For 2007, the dividend rate was announced on Jan 31, 2008.The EPF has yet to release its top 30 equity holdings in Malaysia as at end-2018, with data on its website being that of end-September 2018, at the time of writing.Based on the 35 stocks that were on its top 30 holdings the past four quarters and its shareholding level from stock exchange filings as at end-2018, however, the value of these 35 EPF holdings would have fallen by roughly RM7.5 billion as at end-2018 versus end-2017 — if one were to make a simplistic assumption that its shareholding a year ago was the same as end-2018.The largest declines were from Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Sime Darby Plantations Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd, Digi.com Bhd and Maxis Bhd while the largest gains were seen at Public Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, PPB Group Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd. But the estimated RM11.8 billion decline in market value versus RM4.2 billion estimated gains in market value are a mere guesstimate, at best, and may not mean there will be sizeable equity write-downs.It is worth noting that the EPF has been building a steady income stream, likely with the desire to at least meet its annual minimum dividend payout requirement, come what may.In 2017, dividends on investments came to RM10.33 billion, being 19.4% of total gross investment income. The steady stream of interest and profits it has from its investments gave it another RM13.93 billion in 2017, or 26.22% of gross investment income. In other words, these two income streams alone were enough to pay about 3.4% or nearly half of the EPF’s dividend payout last year.So while EPF chairman Tan Sri Samsudin Osman did not give away much on Jan 15 when asked about the potential dividend payout for 2018, it is clear that the tough market conditions last year has put the fund’s defensive strategy to the test. Should its defensive strategy bear fruit, the stage is set for it to take a pat on the back. If it has been found wanting, a clear direction would be necessary to show that the EPF can rebound stronger than ever this year.

"February 11, 2019 09:06 am +08",TM,"Thinning spread between telco yields and FD rates","KUALA LUMPUR: Gone are the days that telecommunications (telco) stocks on Bursa Malaysia were top picks for dividend play investors, but as competition remains — coupled with underlying regulatory risks — analysts are worried that the dividend yields of these securities will drop below the country’s fixed deposit (FD) rates.The dividend yield of Axiata Group Bhd — one of the Big Three mobile network operators (MNOs) — has dipped below FD rates since early 2017, after the group decided to lower dividend payouts to conserve ammunition for capital expenditure and to face potentially more intense competition and foreign exchange volatility.Bank Negara Malaysia’s monthly statistics show that apart from January last year, when the average three-month FD rate was lower at 3.01%, rates averaged between 3.15% and 3.17% up until November.JF Apex Securities Bhd analyst Siau Li Shen pointed out that the dividend yields of other telco stocks, while not lower than FD rates, have been hovering only marginally above the commercial banks’ less risky option.“The telco sector is still underweight; there are concerns about regulatory risks, as well as existing competition. Currently, there are no significant rerating catalysts. So if everything remains the same throughout the whole of 2019, we are expecting a flattish performance.“Yields from telcos like Maxis Bhd were between 3.5% and 4% last year, so [the] dividend yield is not as attractive as [in] the past; [it’s] just slightly above the FD rate,” he told The Edge Financial Daily when contacted.According to Bloomberg data, apart from Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), which registered an unusually high dividend yield last year due to its share price weakness, DiGi.Com Bhd had the highest yield — though just above 4% — among the three MNOs.DiGi announced a final dividend per share of 4.8 sen or RM373 million last month (January) along with the release of the group’s earnings for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 (4QFY18). This brings its full FY18 dividend payout to 19.6 sen, versus 18.8 sen for FY17.Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Tan J Young shared the view that telcos’ current yields are nothing enticing. “With the expectation that the OPR (Overnight Policy Rate) will stay at 3.25%, telcos’ yields are not attractive enough to spur buying interest,” he said. Despite lowest yield, Axiata has most ‘buys’Interestingly, although Axiata had the lowest dividend yield of 2.12% among its peers, the stock garnered the most “buy” calls from the research fraternity, according to Bloomberg data.BIMB Securities Research analyst Mohamad Khairul Fahmi, who also placed it on “buy” with a target price of RM4.60, said this was attributable to Axiata’s regional exposure.“Axiata has exposure to other countries, unlike Maxis and DiGi.Com [whose] operations are confined to Malaysia, and locally there is norerating catalyst,” he said.JF Apex’s Siau also pointed to concerns about Maxis’ margin after the termination of the 3G Radio Access Network (RAN) share agreement with U Mobile Sdn Bhd.“Their (Maxis) margin may be lower without the 3G RAN share revenue. Although it is extended until the middle of this year, the scope is limited. Overall, [investing in the] telco industry is not very convincing this year,” he said.Last December, U Mobile and Maxis announced that they had entered into an extension of the agreement in limited areas until end-June 2019. The termination was originally supposed to end on Dec 27, 2018.In May 2017, U Mobile chief executive officer Wong Heang Tuck told The Edge Malaysia weekly in an interview that the company paid RM200 million to RM300 million for the RAN sharing service in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2015 (FY15).Nonetheless, BIMB’s Mohamad Khairul thinks that Maxis — like DiGi — is likely to report marginal growth for its FY18 performance and within consensus estimate, while flattening out in FY19.DiGi reported a 5% net profit growth to RM377.8 million for 4QFY18, from RM360.08 million a year ago, as revenue grew 2% to RM1.67 billion from RM1.64 billion. This led to a 4% growth in the group’s full FY18 net profit to RM1.54 billion from RM1.48 billion for FY17, while revenue grew 3% to RM6.53 billion from RM6.34 billion.Mohamad Khairul said MNOs’ performance in 2019 will very much hinge on the innovation in product offerings.“How they are going to perform this year is highly dependent on how innovative they are in their offerings to entice subscribers. The more value they offer, the more subscribers they could acquire,” he said.Mohamad Khairul said increasing Internet consumption on mobile devices is driving Malaysians to move to products offering features relevant to such trends.“For example, U Mobile recently offered their unlimited Internet plan for their prepaid segment, which would stir up some competition. With the SIM migration trend from prepaid to post-paid, telcos are also competing through device-bundled offerings.“People now are more willing to take up higher-value packages because Internet consumption is getting higher compared to few years ago. The same mobile application today is using more data compared to the past,” he added.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/thinning-spread-between-telco-yields-and-fd-rates
"February 08, 2019 10:05 am +08",TM,"‘Proposed clampdown on Android TV box would boost Astro’","KUALA LUMPUR: The government’s plan to ban Android TV boxes would be a positive catalyst to the lacklustre media sector, especially for Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, given the continued effect of digital disruption, says Hong Leong Investment Bank Research (HLIB).It was recently reported that the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), together with the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry, is considering banning the sale of Android set-top boxes (STBs) in Malaysia, mirroring Singapore’s similar move last month.Apart from that, both bodies are cracking down on unauthorised websites that offer illegal streaming.In a note yesterday, HLIB said the sales of Android STBs have been growing rapidly in the last two to three years as a cheaper streaming alternative, which has hampered Pay-TV’s development in Malaysia.“In Malaysia, Astro appears to be the most impacted player with the rapid sale of Android STBs, as evident by its declining premium subscribers in the past three years. However, we note that Astro has managed to slowdown the subscriber loss with NJOI,” it said.Should the ban materialise, HLIB said Astro would be a beneficiary as this could possibly put a halt to — or at least slow down — its declining premium subscriber base and lift its average revenue per user, which is currently at RM99.90.However, ban or no ban, Astro would still face competition from legal streaming platforms like Netflix.In the meantime, another piece of good news for Astro would be Telekom Malaysia Bhd’s (TM’s) announcement that their latest Unifi package would not be bundled with Unifi TV subscription, due to changing consumer trends.“We view the news as a positive for Astro, as this could assist Astro to expand their subscriber base. Astro controlled 77% market share of Pay-TV market in Malaysia and the rest is controlled by TM through Unifi TV,” HLIB said.But following the recent surge in Astro share price, HLIB has downgraded Astro from “buy” to “hold”, with an unchanged target price of RM1.70. HLIB is also keeping the media sector on “underweight”.“Nevertheless, Astro’s earnings prospect remain intact on the back of its stable advertising expenditure outlook and coupled with generous dividend payment of 5% yield,” it added.Astro shares settled unchanged at RM1.66 yesterday after 1.36 million shares were done, with a market capitalisation of RM8.76 billion.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/proposed-clampdown-android-tv-box-would-boost-astro
"February 07, 2019 11:30 am +08",TM,"Government in business needs smart partnerships","In his Budget 2019 speech, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng declared that “the business of the government is not to be in business ... and the government will focus its expenditure and investments only in strategic sectors and areas where free markets and the private sector are not interested or unable to meet the needs of the people and the economy”.Academician Terence Gomez of Universiti Malaya estimated that, as of 2017, government-linked companies (GLCs) owned by the government-linked investment companies (GLICs) constituted 42% of the total market capitalisation of all public-listed firms in Malaysia. At the Malaysia: A New Dawn forum last October, Lim’s political secretary Tony Pua said that divestment of some non-core GLC assets would raise much-needed funds and encourage greater participation of the private sector.How will the government decide which enterprises should be the target of its investment or divestment, and why? The Pakatan Harapan government has a unique opportunity to conduct a fundamental and strategic rethink of the role of the state in business, beyond immediate fundraising and addressing “crowding-out” concerns. At present, the government is missing a public overarching “ownership policy” that discloses when, why and how the government may impose public policy objectives on GLCs and GLICs.One common justification in the 1980s and early 1990s was that the private sector would not otherwise invest in these crucial businesses. This “market-failure” rationale is uncontroversial and often relied on by governments to justify control or ownership of assets and businesses. It was a particularly populist rationale when combined with the bumiputera empowerment agenda as a major social justification for investments.The government implemented this objective through government-linked investment companies such as Khazanah Nasional Bhd and Permodalan Nasional Bhd or by investing in GLCs such as Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and UEM Group Bhd. As capital markets were then relatively underdeveloped, government assistance to start Perwaja Holdings Bhd, Heavy Industries Corp of Malaysia Bhd (Hicom) and Proton Holdings Bhd was thought necessary. Alternatively, it was said that a “big push” by the state was needed to catalyse coordinated upstream and downstream development of certain industry ecosystems, leading to investment in companies such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, a wafer fab and semiconductor manufacturer.Another rationale was that public goods or natural monopoly cost structures required government investment as shareholders in companies involved in these sectors. Unlike companies, whether public or private, the GLCs have to answer to a wider group of stakeholders, beyond the shareholders and investors. The government, as a major or strategic shareholder in the GLCs, has a broader political or social agenda beyond maximising profits.The public, as consumers of the products or services of the GLCs, especially those in utilities or infrastructure, do not favour any increases in tariffs, however well justified. The unions and employees may not necessarily be sympathetic to any restructurings to enhance shareholder value if these steps will result in job losses.The government will have to manage these conflicting objectives and priorities. Nevertheless, as technology disrupts long-standing industry practices, caution should be taken against using this justification to protect an entire industry value chain on this. For example, in Malaysia, electricity transmission may continue to be a natural monopoly but not electricity generation, with the advent of independent power producers with substantial private sector investments.The concept of “strategic sectors” is more controversial. Practically every government investment has been called “strategic” at least once before! What makes an investment truly so? Most state investments were and continue to be justified on the ground that they are critical to serve as a catalyst for industry development or economic growth. Examples include Boustead Holdings Bhd in defence and Telekom Malaysia in telecommunications — major GLCs whose dominance in the industries are often justified on national security or geopolitical reasons. This rationale should not be too quickly dismissed as outdated or even socialist.The Washington Consensus prescribing wholesale deregulation and privatisation has collapsed. The rise of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), particularly China, has provided a tempting, alternative, state-driven developmental model. On the other hand, the UEM Group was acquired as a GLC in the wake of the 1998 Asian financial crisis, the rationale being that its potential collapse posed systemic risks to the banking sector and capital markets. Nevertheless, the fact that the acquisitions were strategic then does not necessarily mean that the government should continue to own a substantial stake in them.We have two concerns on the dominance of government in business. First, government ownership or control of strategic businesses or assets must avoid any unintended “crowding out” or undermining of our robust and successful private sector. The previous approach of opaquely selecting individuals as “national champions” has been criticised as an example of cronyism and state capture. Indeed, “picking winners” has, ironically, often left us with losers requiring subsequent government bailout such as Perwaja Steel and Malaysian Airline System Bhd.If the government’s approach is to target entire “strategic sectors” as suggested by the finance minister, it can facilitate competition by backing not one, but multiple, competing firms. For all the criticisms of the national car project, it was courageous of the government to pit two competitors, Proton and Perodua, against each other. If this competitive approach can be adopted in the automobile industry with its high-capital intensity and strong economies of scale, why not emulate it in other industry sectors?An alternative approach is to ensure that where the government undertakes business activities in competition with the private sector, they do so on a fair and equitable basis. In 2000, the state government of Victoria, in adopting a competitive neutrality policy, defined it as “the elimination of resource allocation distortions arising out of the public ownership of entities engaged in significant business activities”. In short, government business should not enjoy any net competitive advantage simply as a result of its public sector ownership.Second, substantial funds are usually required for the government to exercise control or influence over a GLC. The traditional majority ownership stake gives the government both ongoing control and a share in the upside of the business. With respect, we believe it is neither necessary nor important for the government to always own or have majority control of every enterprise that it invests in. It is possible to structure alternative mechanisms for the government to achieve this objective without necessarily having to own a substantial stake. Where both control and share of profits is not needed, the government can provide finance by way of debt through the many state-owned development banks.This is applicable to small and medium enterprises and projects in conventional, relatively low-risk industries. Where a share of profits is needed but not full control, the government could take a minority stake or legal devices like royalty rights over intellectual property. For high-technology or start-up investments, this “light-touch” portfolio approach to investment is more appropriate. Where control is needed but a share of profits is not, there is always the time-hallowed but heavy-handed golden share. But, its use should be limited to truly strategic enterprises as they bear the risk of abuse without direct financial returns to the state.Where the government needs to maintain majority shareholdings, there is all the more reason to ensure good governance of GLICs and GLCs. While GLC governance has improved since the completion of the GLC Transformation Programme in 2015, the recent controversies at Lembaga Tabung Haji indicate that there is room for improvement. Beyond the recent specific reforms for TH, broader reforms across all GLCs and GLICs are needed. Transparency and disclosure of specific data on GLIC investment performance as well as on the appointment criteria and remuneration of directors at GLCs and GLICs can be improved. To this end, the government can resuscitate the idea of a State-Owned Enterprise and Government-Linked Companies Act.Moving forward, we suggest the government should recalibrate its focus from sectors to technologies. Given Malaysia’s so-called “middle-income trap”, the government should invest with the aim of fostering innovation. As the economist Mariana Mazzucato noted in her book, The Entrepreneurial State, innovation is highly uncertain, collective and cumulative, and has long lead times. Hence, the need for “patient” capital by the state, as opposed to private venture-capital funding, which can be excessively focused on short-term exits.Even radical inventions like the smartphone have been traced back ultimately to research funded by the US government. If the state promotes “general-purpose” technologies such as artificial intelligence and renewable energy, private sector investment can be “crowded-in” by the spawning of entirely new markets for products and services. One would not describe most GLCs as paragons of such innovation.In Malaysia, we already have state-owned venture capital funds such as Malaysia Technology Development Corp, Malaysia Debt Ventures Bhd and Cradle Fund Sdn Bhd. The streamlining of these funds as well as the RM2 billion matching grants announced in Budget 2019, while laudable, do not go far enough. The sums they have invested so far are miniscule compared to that by the GLICs. This may be understandable given these VC funds’ mandates to support early-stage or seed financing. Whereas GLICs like the Employees’ Provident Fund, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan Diperbadankan and Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera need reliable cash cows, not uncertain start-up moonshots, to consistently deliver annual dividends.We believe choosing between profitability and innovation is not a zero-sum game. To raise funds for investments in innovative companies, GLICs can divest stakes in certain asset-rich GLCs that have persistent losses or low profitability, no business synergies with other GLCs and insignificant strategic or social value. These will contribute little to GLICs’ cash flows in any case, even in the long term. For example, the Rangkaian Hotel Seri Malaysia Sdn Bhd is owned by no less than Minister of Finance Inc (MoF Inc) and operates 19 hotels throughout Malaysia but has suffered occupancy, branding and management challenges over the past decade.Neither do we advocate a 360° change in GLIC risk appetites and investment strategy. Some of the funds raised from divestments of unprofitable investments can be channelled into risky early-stage financing via state-owned VC funds, with the balance to be retained by the GLICs for safer late-stage investments in more mature companies.Khazanah and MoF Inc, the more “strategically-oriented” among the seven GLICs, would be most suited for this mission. Khazanah has already invested in successful tech firms such as Phunware Inc in 2009 and Garena and Blippar in 2016. However, as reported by New Straits Times on Jan 11, 2019, Khazanah’s current investment in innovation and technology companies stands at only 4% of its total portfolio. If carefully managed, a gradual shift in GLIC portfolios further towards more mature tech investments need not significantly affect GLICs’ risk profile.Malaysian GLICs and GLICs are currently, at best, maintaining a comfortable existence. But, if well-focused, well-governed and well-regulated, they can have tremendous potential in unlocking creative destruction or disruption in businesses without crowding out the private sector. This smart partnership between the public and private sectors can propel Malaysia to the next stage of economic growth.Chew Seng Kok is the managing director of ZICO Holdings Inc, a company listed on the Singapore Exchange’s Catalist board.

However, we note that Astro has managed to slowdown the subscriber loss with NJOI,” it said.Should the ban materialise, HLIB notes Astro would be a beneficiary as this could possibly put a halt (or at least slowdown) to its declining premium subscriber base and possibly lift its average revenue per user (ARPU) (currently at RM99.90).However, it said despite the ban on Android STBs, Astro would still face competition from legal streaming platforms, such as Netflix.Regardless, another good news for Astro would be that Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) announced their latest Unifi package would not be bundled with Unifi TV subscription, due to changing consumer trends.“We view the news as a positive for Astro, as this could assist Astro to expand their subscriber base. Astro controlled 77% market share of Pay-TV market in Malaysia and the rest is controlled by TM through Unifi TV,” HLIB said.HLIB maintains Underweight rating on the media sector.“Following the recent surge in Astro share price, we downgrade Astro from Buy to Hold, with an unchanged Target Price of RM1.70. Nevertheless, Astro’s earnings prospect remain intact on the back of its stable advertising expenditure outlook and coupled with generous dividend payment of 5% yield,” it added.At 10.41am, Astro rose 0.60% or 1 sen to RM1.67, with 518,400 shares traded. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/clampdown-android-tv-box-would-boost-lacklustre-media-sector-especially-astro
"February 05, 2019 17:00 pm +08",TM,"Mesiniaga’s big break ? ","THERE was frenzied buying of Mesiniaga Bhd shares following news that the company had secured a contract worth RM1.9 billion to manage a submarine cable that will be built to connect Hong Kong and Malaysia.The stock hit RM1.75 last Wednesday — the highest level since August 2014. For the week, it soared 54 sen or 46.55% to RM1.70 after the award of the Enhancing Malaysia International Internet Gateway (EM-IIG) contract was announced.Mesiniaga tells The Edge that the contract is for the supply and implementation of core, aggregation and access network equipment as well as its support system.“The equipment will be used to connect the main network with the international gateway and provide internet service to the Malaysian public,” it says.However, in an unexpected twist, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail later issued a statement saying that the government did not commit to anything relating to EM-IIG, which is undertaken by a private company, Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn Bhd. The firm is controlled by executive chairman Datuk Seri Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahim, who is the brother of former Lembaga Tabung Haji chairman Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim.This has raised concerns over the viability of the project.Xiddig, a little-known company, has welcomed the publicity. “It’s a blessing in disguise,” says Abdul Rashid. “[The recent news] gives a good message to the country that we are coming, we are ready.”The EM-IIG is a high-speed broadband project boasting 7,500km of the “world’s fastest” 150TB undersea cable connecting Hong Kong and Malaysia, and 110,000km of land cables plus five cable landing stations nationwide, which will cost a whopping RM5.4 billion in total.The project, which was first reported in 2017, is solely owned by Xiddig — which, until recently, was mainly involved in the provision of mobile virtual network services.Sole ownership of undersea cable projects is uncommon. Even the likes of Telekom Malaysia Bhd — which has a couple of such projects — has worked with others as a consortium to undertake such mammoth tasks.Others, like TIME dotCom Bhd, hold strategic stakes in international submarine cable systems while owning their own cable landing stations.What really caught public attention in the case of Xiddig, however, was what transpired at the official launch of the project last week.At the event, former Penang deputy chief minister Datuk Rashid Hasnon was reported to have read out a speech to officiate the event — meant to be delivered by Wan Azizah — which underlined the government’s commitment to the project.To that, Abdul Rashid remarked that the issue is being politicised.According to him, based on official communications, key members of the government, including Wan Azizah and Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo, were “very supportive” of the venture previously.Others, like Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng, are also aware of the project as Xiddig has been holding roadshows on the project in all states over the past few years, he says.“We gave a presentation to the MCMC (Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission),” Abdul Rashid says, adding that it was very helpful and granted Xiddig a submarine cable landing licence.“None of us are politicians ... we are 100% business people.”He says EM-IIG is fully private sector-driven, the necessary funding has been secured and it has found reputable partners to execute the project.Xiddig, according to Abdul Rashid, has entered into contracts with integrated turnkey submarine network solutions provider Alcatel Submarine Networks for the provision and laying of the undersea cables. Work is expected to start in three months’ time.US-based CommScope Inc will provide the land cables while Mesiniaga will manage the system when it comes onstream before the end of the year.On Mesiniaga, Abdul Rashid says the company was chosen partly because of its track record as a vendor for other telecommunications companies. “Other bids in the open tenders, including by several overseas players, were too expensive.”But with cash equivalents of RM31.05 million as at its latest quarter, does Mesiniaga have the capacity to take on the project?“Xiddig’s payments will be made progressively over 24 months, in accordance with the terms of the contract,” he says.Hence, comes the question of funding, considering the size of the project, the apparent tie-up with prominent names in the industry and Xiddig’s lack of a track record in carrying out such a huge venture.Abdul Rashid notes that Xiddig has already raised the funds for the entire project by selling preference shares in a special purpose vehicle, Xiddig Technology.Details, however, were not shared. “We have signed a non-disclosure agreement with [the funders],” he says.Meanwhile, Xiddig also needs to sort out other issues, such as getting the right of way to land for its land cable network and, more importantly, securing off-takers for the additional capacity from the project.The big plan is to provide fibre-to-the-home services under the Xiddig brand and sell the capacity to corporations and other telcos, says Abdul Rashid.None of this has materialised yet, but Xiddig says local telco tower owners have already inked letters of intent with it to buy data when the project comes onstream.“This is a revenue-generating project for the country. It can also improve the internet speed for Malaysians,” says Abdul Rashid. “Sometimes, we feel sad that the [issues that cropped up following the project launch] were blown out of proportion.” ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mesiniagas-big-break
"January 29, 2019 16:00 pm +08",TM,"Newsbreak: TM may be selling VADS ","TELEKOM Malaysia Bhd (TM) is looking to hive off its wholly-owned business process outsourcing outfit VADS Bhd, or its units, sources familiar with the matter tell The Edge. According to a source, a handful of buyers have already been shortlisted.Another source revealed the proposed disposal has been ongoing for some time now, and that he is familiar with some of the bidders but is unclear on current developments.“But I do know it (the planned sale) has been ongoing for some time now,” he says.Others familiar with the details were tight-lipped, and would only divulge the possible participation of Deloitte Singapore in managing the sale.TM’s response to requests for comments was brief: “With regards to talks on the sale of VADS Bhd, TM would like to reiterate that it does not comment on matters of speculation.”Another source highlights that things could also have changed at TM after CEO Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazalli Ramly left in June last year, followed by acting CEO Datuk Bazlan Osman in November. Former COO Shazril Imri Mokhtar was left to run the company as acting CEO.At present VADS is parked under TM One, which comes under the TM umbrella.The business process outsourcing outfit has several units, including VADS Business Process Sdn Bhd, PT VADS Indonesia, VADS Digital Sdn Bhd, VADS e-Services Sdn Bhd, VADS Professional Services Sdn Bhd and VADS Solutions Sdn Bhd.In the financial year ended December 2017 (FY2017), VADS registered an after tax profit of RM251.06 million on the back of RM594.23 million in revenue, a check on RAM Rating reveals. However, the profit figure for that year seems distorted as in FY2016, the company made a loss of RM26.24 million.In the three financial years prior to that, its earnings rose markedly, growing from RM5.29 million in FY2013 to RM39.76 million in FY2014 and doubling to RM79.57 million in FY2015.As at end-December 2017, VADS had RM374.81 million in current assets and RM169.89 million in non-current assets, while current liabilities amounted to RM254.45 million. It had no long-term debt commitments.Its parent, TM, ended trading last Friday at RM2.78. Over the past year TM has lost more than half of its value, the erosion came largely after the government announced that telcos would have to adhere to the mandatory standards on access pricing, which meant lower fixed broadband prices.For the nine months ended September 2018, TM registered a net profit of RM83.49 million on RM8.73 billion in revenue. In the third quarter, the state-owned telco suffered a net loss of RM175.59 million on RM2.95 billion revenue, largely a result of impairments of RM934.8 million.As at end-September 2018, TM had cash and bank balances of RM2.19 billion, and on the other side of the balance sheet it had long-term borrowings of RM7.55 billion and short-term debt obligations of RM1.34 billion. For the nine months, it forked out RM315.6 million in finance costs.VADS was previously public listed but in 2008, in an effort to boost its earnings, TM privatised its 63%-owned unit and delisted the company the following year.Its RM417.3 million offer, RM7.60 per share, was a 12% premium to VADS’ then closing price. However some analysts were of the view its fair value was closer to RM8.70 a share. The stock’s average fair value from six analysts compiled by Bloomberg was RM7.70.“The privatisation of VADS will accord the TM group greater flexibility to streamline its businesses to maximise potential synergies and cost-saving benefits,” TM said in a statement to Bursa Malaysia after the privatisation exercise. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/newsbreak-tm-may-be-selling-vads
"January 17, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TM,"Cover Story: On the defensive","LAST week, the global equity rout picked up from where it left off in 2018 amid renewed concerns about slowing world economic growth and the repercussions of the ongoing US-China trade war.With most of the uncertainties faced in 2018 still unresolved, whether it was the trade tensions, global economic growth, the hiking of interest rates by the US Federal Reserve or Brexit, investor reaction has been to opt for less risky assets.Malaysian stocks were not spared the selldown as the FBM KLCI saw its worst first trading day of the year since 2016, tumbling 1.33% to close at 1,668.11 points last Wednesday. In the last decade, 2012 and 2016 were the only times the benchmark index fell more than 1% on the first trading day of the year.Areca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong, who believes much of the selldown was driven by negative investor sentiment, advises those who are tired of the volatile market to take a defensive stance for the time being.“Of course, investors who are weary of the negative sentiment affecting the market can deploy a temporary defensive strategy, pending a clearer picture on the economic front,” he says, adding that the fundamentals of some of the listed companies remained intact.According to Wong, some of these companies offer attractive dividend yields following the sharp decline in the market in the last one year. “Apart from dividend yields, investors could also benefit when the share prices of some of these companies recover,” he tells The Edge.Acknowledging that it is difficult to time the market, he says long-term investors with an investment horizon of three to five years could start accumulating stocks with strong fundamentals and sustainable business models.He believes that Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) is a good defensive stock for one’s portfolio. It is the largest company listed on Bursa Malaysia by market capitalisation and offers an attractive dividend yield of 6.1%.Wong opines that the recent selldown presents a great opportunity for investors to accumulate Maybank, which is a solid long-term play, given its dominance in the local banking sector.“If you look at Maybank, it is giving a good yield of 5% to 6%. While there might be a prolonged weakness in the stock market, it still gives a good entry point for investors who want to have exposure to one of the largest banks in the country. Compared with its high last year, the stock has fallen quite a bit. I think investors can benefit from the sustainable dividend payout as well as the upside potential in the event of a recovery in the stock market as a whole,” he says.Maybank has fallen about 8.8% from a recent high of RM10.262. Compared with 2017, the bank managed to eke out total returns of 1.4% last year. Nonetheless, it was not spared the selldown in 4Q2018 as it lost more than 4% of its value during the quarter.Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of research Kenny Yee also expects volatility to reign this year, emanating from the US as the Fed is expected to continue to raise its interest rates.“Such volatility is expected to cause ripples in the Asian markets. Overall, we believe investors are now more risk-averse and would prefer to accumulate on weakness in stocks with solid value propositions. As before, there are no outstanding sectors as we prefer to go bottom up,” he says.Another fund manager with a local asset management company tells The Edge that going for dividend plays, such as real estate investment trusts and consumer-related stocks, would be a good strategy while waiting for a clearer picture to emerge on the economic front. For example, both Pavilion REIT and IGB REIT offer decent yields of 5.4% and 5.3% respectively. They own popular malls such as the Pavilion Shopping Mall, and Mid Valley Megamall and The Gardens Mall respectively and posted higher rental income in their latest quarterly results.Beverage companies such as Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd and Nestlé (M) Bhd could also be good defensive plays. Both F&N and Nestlé were among the top performers last year, recording total returns of 28% and 47.4% respectively, despite the sharp decline in the overall equity market. Heineken and Carlsberg also performed well, recording total returns of 9% and 38.3% respectively in the same period, and offer decent yields of 3% to 4%. Click / Tap image to enlarge However, the fund manager notes that it is important for investors to look at companies that have a strong balance sheet and are able to maintain their dividend payouts as these could be trimmed if a global economic slowdown hits corporate incomes. He cites Uchi Technologies Bhd, Apollo Food Holdings Bhd, Classic Scenic Bhd and Asia File Corp Bhd as examples.According to Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) head of research Jeremy Goh, among the companies that are expected to offer attractive dividends is Taliworks Corp Bhd as the Selangor water consolidation exercise should be completed by the first half of this year. “Assuming the management follows the repayment schedule proposed by Pengurusan Air Selangor Sdn Bhd, the company could distribute a total dividend of 7.2 sen, which translates into 9.2% based on its closing price of 78.5 sen last Thursday,” Goh says.There is also the possibility of a lump sum upfront special dividend if the management chooses to monetise the receivables to third-party institutions.Goh adds that a stock selection strategy is required amid the uncertainties in the market. “I think we have to look at stock specifics in the current environment as opposed to broader-based sector allocation,” he explains, noting that one of the key sectors to benefit from Budget 2019 is healthcare.In November last year, the Pakatan Harapan government announced that the allocation for health services would be increased by about 7.8% to RM29 billion as it aimed to improve the quality of healthcare in the country. It also introduced the B40 National Health Protection Fund, available from Jan 1, on a partnership basis with private insurance companies.In the partnership, the government will pilot the fund to provide free protection against the top four critical illnesses of up to RM8,000 and up to 14 days of hospitalisation income cover at RM50 per day. Great Eastern Life Insurance was mentioned as one of the first insurance companies to agree to a RM2 billion contribution to the fund, which will be managed by Bank Negara Malaysia.Goh believes the B40 National Health Protection Fund will divert some of the patients from government hospitals to private hospitals, which, in turn, will benefit healthcare players.HLIB has highlighted UEM Edgenta Bhd as a beneficiary of potential higher work orders from the Ministry of Health. It has a 10-year concession for 32 hospitals in the northern region (ending 2025) and saw its healthcare segment account for 46% of its revenue and 41% of its profit before tax in the first nine months of its financial year ended Sept 30, 2018.An analyst who spoke to The Edge on condition of anonymity says selective export manufacturers could be a good bet with the ringgit hovering at a lower level than the average of 4.03 against the US dollar last year. The ringgit was trading at 4.14 against the greenback at the time of writing.“If you look at where the ringgit is today, the exporters are already benefiting by about 3% from foreign exchange alone. Of course, with concerns about a global economic slowdown, not all the exporters will benefit. The more resilient ones, such as the glove manufacturers, could be a good option,” he says.It is worth noting, however, that the US dollar’s strength could weaken this year with a slower pace of rate hikes by the Fed.While it is uncertain if the glove manufacturers will be able to maintain their strong growth momentum, they performed well last year, both in terms of share price and financial results on the back of capacity expansion in the last few years. Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Top Glove Corp Bhd, the top two glove manufacturers by market capitalisation, saw total returns of 19.9% and 42.7% respectively last year and also became FBM KLCI constituents. Traditional defensive plays down in 2018The traditional defensive playbook may not work in current conditions as the local market faces additional pressures from the change in government last May, the analyst says.He sees the struggles of traditional defensive counters, such as the utility and telecommunications players, as evidence of investors needing to be aware of regulatory and political risks as well. Telekom Malaysia Bhd, which offers a dividend yield of more than 4%, has fallen more than 50% in the last one year while Tenaga Nasional Bhd has lost about 7.1% in the same period.Recall that Minister of Communications and Multimedia Gobind Singh Deo pushed the telcos to double the internet speed in the country for half the price on his first day at work, triggering a selloff in the telecoms giant on concerns over the impact on its bottom line.Other blue-chip counters affected by policy change are the gaming counters, which were impacted by the higher taxes announced in Budget 2019. Genting Malaysia Bhd and Genting Bhd have fallen 44.4% and 35.7% respectively in the last one year. Similarly, despite the allure of high dividend yields among the number forecast operators (NFOs) such as Magnum Bhd and Berjaya Sports Toto, analysts remain sceptical about the sustainability of high payouts in the current environment. Both Magnum and BToto have a dividend yield of 8.2% and 7.5% respectively. Are REITs still defensive despite rising rates?While REITs are perceived to be defensive, they also compete with 10-year Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) that offer a yield of 4.07%. The Edge Financial Daily reported recently that the 18 REITs listed on Bursa produced an unexciting 1.88% yield spread over the 10-year MGS yield, which is a typical benchmark to compare returns from REITs.Be that as it may, REITs may still be an asset class for retail investors seeking defensive plays and have little access to MGS.One of the risks in this space is the rising interest rate environment. Further hikes could potentially lower the profitability of Malaysian REITs with higher finance costs and deferred acquisitions. Recall that Bank Negara raised its overnight policy rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 3.25% in January last year. So far, most economists are expecting the OPR to remain unchanged for the rest of the year.Nonetheless, Bloomberg data shows that most of the analysts have a “buy” or “hold” call on REITs following their decline last year. Among the 11 companies that are covered by analysts, the average return based on their target price is 7.7%.Three analysts have a “buy” call on Al-Aqar’ Healthcare REIT with the highest potential return of 23.4%. Most analysts have cited its unique position as a defensive healthcare REIT for their “buy” call.Only KLCCP Stapled Group and Axis REIT have a negative return based on the analysts’ target prices for the year.Maybank IB Research analyst Kevin Wong says in a 2018 strategy report that the growth of the REIT space this year could largely be organic via positive rental reversions and sustained occupancy rates as some of the REITs would record full-year rental income contributions from assets that were acquired or developed in 2018. These include Axis REIT, Pavilion REIT and YTL Hospitality REIT.“Due to an ongoing oversupply of retail and office space, particularly in the Klang Valley, we continue to favour prime malls in prominent locations such as Mid Valley Megamall, Pavilion, Suria KLCC and Sunway Pyramid and office assets with long-term tenants such as the Petronas Twin Towers and Menara Shell,” Wong says, adding that YTL Hospitality REIT is his top buy due to its resilient earnings from its Malaysian and Japanese assets, which are on master leases with rental step-ups.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-defensive

Izzadin had been at the helm of UEM since July 2009.Mohd Izani, who will turn 50 this year, is currently executive director of investments and overseeing executive director of Khazanah’s regional office in Turkey.He joined Khazanah in March 2005, after stints with government-controlled Putrajaya Holdings Sdn Bhd and the Renong group. He was Khazanah’s chief financial officer for seven years before assuming the current role in June 2017.Mohd Izani currently sits on the board of Khazanah’s 33.21%-owned unit, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, as a non-independent non-executive director, chairman of the board’s nomination and remuneration committee and a member of the audit committee and the finance and investment committee. He is also a board member of MAHB’s wholly-owned Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen International Airport Investment Development and Operation Inc and LGM Airport Operations Trade and Tourism Inc.Apart from the above, he is also on the board of Bank Muamalat Bhd — an Islamic bank, in which Khazanah has 30% equity interest — and a director of Fajar Capital Ltd, Rantau Abang Capital Bhd, Feringghi Capital Ltd, Klebang Capital Ltd, Lido Capital Ltd and Cenang Capital Ltd, among others.Mohd Izani has a degree in political science from The London School of Economics and Political Science, the UK, and a Bachelor of Science (Economics), after which he pursued an accounting degree under the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and was admitted as a fellow in 1998. He is also a member of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants.His appointment is key as it comes at a time when the government is looking at restructuring or even hiving off some its assets.UEM is among the key holding companies for Khazanah. As at end-December 2017, UEM had total assets of RM26.83 billion, long-term borrowings of RM9.51 billion and short-term debt commitments amounting to RM5.31 billion.For the year ended December 2017, it posted an after-tax profit of RM742.9 million on revenue of RM7.05 billion. To put things in perspective, the group had RM6.9 billion in accumulated profits.Among the more prominent companies under UEM are 51%-owned highway operator PLUS Malaysia Bhd, publicly traded UEM Edgenta Bhd (68.15%), UEM Sunrise Bhd (66%) and Cement Industries of Malaysia Bhd as well as construction player UEM Builders Bhd.The remaining 49% stake in PLUS Malaysia is held by the Employees Provident Fund.There have been two proposals to take over PLUS Malaysia — by Tan Sri Abu Sahid Mohamed and his Maju group, and Tan Sri Halim Saad — but the government’s stance is not clear.Halim’s plan to take over PLUS Malaysia generated much interest as he used to control the Renong group and United Engineers Malaysia Bhd, which morphed into UEM after Khazanah took over the assets from him.There has also been interest reportedly shown in UEM’s stake in UEM Sunrise.A few years ago, there was talk of UEM Builders being hived off, but this has since died down.Other assets under the Khazanah banner that can be sold or have its shareholding pared down include Malaysia Airlines Bhd (wholly owned by Khazanah), Telekom Malaysia Bhd (where Khazanah has a 26.21% stake), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (28.14%) and semiconductor manufacturer SilTerra Malaysia Sdn Bhd. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/newsbreak-mohd-izani-likely-take-helm-uem
"January 11, 2019 19:17 pm +08",TM,"Banks jump into cashless payments with PayNet’s real-time platform","KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 11): The Malaysian banking sector has hopped onboard the cashless bandwagon with Payments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd’s (PayNet) implementation of the real-time Retail Payments Platform, setting in place the foundation to accelerate the growth of cashless payments in the country.PayNet — which has Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) as its largest shareholder and other major banks in Malaysia as joint shareholders — is pushing on with the implementation of interoperable quick response (QR) code initiative, which will allow participating e-wallet services to use a single QR standard for payments for goods and services.This means that consumers would not need to switch between the different services provided by banks such as Maybank’s QRPay and CIMB’s CIMB Pay, and non-banks such as Boost and Favepay to make payments, as merchants will display a single QR code that will be compatible with multiple e-wallet services.PayNet had launched DuitNow — an instant credit transfer service allowing consumers to send money between accounts under different banks by using mobile phone numbers or other identification numbers — last month, an example of how RPP can accelerate the development of Malaysia’s payments ecosystem. PayNet group chief executive officer Peter Schiesser said the launch of DuitNow was an important milestone in efforts to modernise Malaysia’s payments ecosystem, with the company proceeding to enable the inter-operability of QR payments this year.“As you know, there are a lot of e-wallet players in the market provided by both banks and non-bank players. It won’t do much good if a consumer has one of these e-wallets, but not being able to use it for all merchants.“In payments, if you don’t have ubiquity, things will eventually die off,” he said during a media briefing today.Schiesser said the interoperable QR codes will come into force in June this year. Following this, PayNet intends to roll-out other services related to payments collection by leveraging on RPP, which will likely be implemented in 2020.This includes the ability for consumers to set e-mandates to grant authority to service providers, such as Telekom Malaysia Bhd for example, to be able to automatically debit users’ accounts when payment is due.Secondly, PayNet is looking to implement real-time direct debit, which would open up the ability of prepaid services, such as for Touch n’ Go cards to be automatically topped up when the balance goes down to a certain limit.Thirdly, the RPP opens up the ability for request-to-pay, where a service provider like Tenaga Nasional Bhd could automatically send a request for payment for an electricity bill that is due in the form of an alert on a user’s mobile phone.The user can then access their respective banking app to pay the bill at their leisure.This function can also be used between users, whereby one user can request a payment from another user.“These are the sort of things that can be done with these intrinsic functions. They serve purposes in themselves but these different functions can also be combined and used in different ways,” said Schiesser.However, he said Malaysians are currently still very much reliant on cash as a force of habit, seeing as consumers are too comfortable with paying for goods and services with physical money, which has been a factor behind the relatively slow adoption of e-payments.He opined that the government plays an important role in changing the habits of consumers.“In certain aspects, the government has adopted e-payments but what I would like to personally see is for the government to do more around this. If the people get to interact more with the government through electronic means, the more likely it will be that they would use it elsewhere in their lives.“The government has been making some steps but I would really like to see if they can push it a bit more. The current government has been quite supportive of e-payments, so hopefully, we will move in that direction,” Schiesser said.Beyond Malaysia, PayNet is also looking to enable cross border instant credit transfer and peer-to-peer payments, with an initial focus on Southeast Asia.While there have been talks with neighbouring countries including Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, Schiesser said developments have been rather slow.“Things have been going a bit slower than we would like. There are no regulatory barriers for us to link the different nations’ systems, but it’s just that the countries are really focused on their own agendas — on developing their respective infrastructures,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysia-still-some-way-being-cashless-society-%E2%80%94-paynet

Maintain underweight: Several Internet service providers have launched new high-speed broadband (HSBB) packages, leveraging on Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s (TNB) fibre optic infrastructure in Jasin. 
TNB’s three-month pilot project in Jasin was implemented through the RM1 billion National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP) initiative announced in Budget 2019, and this has resulted in a successful rollout of new HSBB packages by Astro, Maxis, Digi, Celcom and City Broadband.Although this is negative to Telekom Malaysia (TM) as it introduces new competition into the fixed line broadband segment, connectivity is only restricted to limited areas covering 1,100 homes in Jasin. Impact on the respective players is expected to be immaterial but it remains to be seen whether TNB could also rollout similar arrangement with service providers in other locations throughout the country.Astro’s participation is within our expectations as we believe convergence is the key to remaining relevant in the fast-changing telecommunication and Internet industry. We believe this deal would be value accretive to Astro as we reckon that Astro’s 92% household penetration in Jasin is predominantly Astro NJOI, which does not generate any TV subscription revenue currently.However, any earnings contribution is not expected to be significant in the near term as this is only a trial project and it will depend on the take-up rate by the eligible households.Connectivity to underserved areas remains unanswered. At this juncture, we are still uncertain whether TNB is capable of rolling out HSBB in untapped areas that have yet to be connected with existing fibre network.If TNB can only provide services to areas that are already currently served by existing networks, then TNB has little differentiation from incumbent telco players apart from offering products at lower price points. Overall, we believe this could bring potential revenue growth to TNB through rental of the fibre infrastructure but earnings impact is expected to be insignificant to the group.City Broadband, which is TNB’s wholly-owned subsidiary, is among the broadband players participating in the pilot project. For TNB to compete directly against existing broadband players in a meaningful manner, we believe significant investment is required for last-mile connectivity. — PublicInvest Research, Jan 9",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/investment-lastmile-connectivity-seen-necessary-tnb

(Jan 9, RM2.65)
Downgrade to sell with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM2.30: Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB, RM13.64, Buy, TP: RM18) yesterday rolled out its National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP) pilot project in Jasin, Melaka. TNB has about 12,000km of fibre-optic cables across the country and the group in September 2018 started a pilot project in Jasin to assess the technical, safety and commercial viability of using its infrastructure for the government’s NFCP to allow faster, cheaper and wider Internet accessibility. TNB in December 2018 said that the pilot project, technically, has been very successful.Under the pilot project, several Internet providers will offer packages to residents in Jasin, including Astro, Celcom, City Broadband, Digi and Maxis. Maxis and Celcom are the familiar names in the broadband space while the presence of Astro, Digi and City Broadband are noteworthy.The Edge reported that Astro (ASTRO, RM1.42, Buy, TP: RM1.77) has started a pilot project in Jasin, offering bundled broadband Internet with Astro’s Family Pack at RM99/month (50Mbps) and RM129/month (100Mbps) starting February 2019. The Astro’s Family Pack content offering includes channels like Astro Ria, Astro Prima and NatGeo WILD, among others. The new package is priced at a 23% discount to the existing 30Mbps Astro-Maxis IPTV package.A reputable blog on Malaysia telecommunication companies, soyacincau, reported that Digi (DIGI, RM4.44, Hold, TP: RM4.38) is offering broadband packages at RM95/month (50Mbps) and RM129/month (100Mbps).City Broadband, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TNB, offers competitive packages ranging from RM79/month (50Mbps) to RM199/month (1Gbps). City Broadband is a relatively new entrant to the broadband space and is currently focused in Cyberjaya.We do not expect the pilot project in Jasin to have any material earnings impact on its participants, considering the small coverage area involving only 1,100 households. There are few indications whether the current arrangements would evolve into a feasible long-term business plans. However, these pilot projects offer a glimpse into the possible business opportunities for the participants, as well as the likely implications on Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM).Assuming TNB, and the participants, are to roll out their respective packages nationwide under the following arrangements, we expect:• Astro to see an overall increase in paying subscribers, targeting the Astro NJOI upgraders. Astro’s new bundle package prices are competitive vis-à-vis the offerings from TM and the existing Astro-Maxis IPTV packages. The package looks especially attractive to new broadband subscribers and upgraders from the Astro NJOI (a free satellite television service).  • TNB to see earnings diversification, as the group may benefit as both the wholesaler and retailer (via City Broadband).• Maxis (MAXIS, RM5.64, Sell, TP: RM5) may leverage TNB’s network to expand its broadband coverage area, as per its broadband aspiration. This should help lower its capital expenditure requirements. However, higher participation from peers may increase the competition and erode its broadband margins.  • Digi has yet to unveil its long-term broadband plans. In view of its uncompetitive package prices (under the pilot project), we believe Digi is still at an exploratory phase regarding the broadband market.• TNB’s high-speed fibre network should provide an irresistible option for TM’s 1.1 million Streamyx subscribers, given the significant speed upgrades (30Mbps-50Mbps versus 1Mbps-8Mbps) and lower subscription prices. Elsewhere, the competitive product offerings from Maxis/City Broadband may lure TM’s 1.2 million unifi subscribers.We are downgrading TM to “sell” (from “hold”) with an unchanged discounted cash flow-derived TP of RM2.30, in view of higher downside risk to the share price — TM’s share price has rallied by 13% since its third quarter of financial year 2018 (3QFY18) results release on Nov 26, 2018; its current share price of RM2.61 implies 12% downside to our TP of RM2.30 — and the emergence of new competitor(s) in the broadband market. At 20 times FY19 estimate (FY19E) price-earnings ratio, TM’s valuation looks pricey, considering the challenging business environment, likely contraction in FY19E core earnings and its heavy balance sheet.Key risks to our negative view on TM are robust broadband subscriber growth/stable broadband average revenue per user, no changes in Streamyx package price, drastic cost rationalisation measures/changes in business strategy (that is, restructuring of Webe business), and stronger-than-expected earnings. — Affin Hwang Capital Research, Jan 9",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/new-competitors-broadband-market-seen-tm
"January 09, 2019 08:59 am +08",TM,"No reprieve seen yet for telcos","KUALA LUMPUR: It has been over seven months since Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo first clocked in at the ministry’s office in Putrajaya, yet analysts continue to view regulatory risk as a concern for the telecommunications (telco) industry, along with the sector’s inherent risk of competition.“We are neutral on the sector as we think the industry will continue to be challenging in 2019 due to regulatory risk and usual competition,” JF Apex Securities Bhd analyst Lee Cherng Wee told The Edge Financial Daily.All telco counters on Bursa Malaysia ended 2018 with lower share prices. In particular, broadband giant Telekom Malaysia Bhd’s (TM) stocks were severely hit after Gobind announced the government’s demand for higher Internet speed with lower prices in the country.“For TM, which was bashed down in 2018, we have a ‘hold’ call because there is no catalyst for upside, and they have slashed dividends. [So] unless there are earnings surprises ...,” Lee said.For mobile network operators (MNOs), Lee expects them to remain cost-focused and focussed on improving cost efficiency this year.“Our top pick is Axiata Group Bhd, with a target price of RM4.95, as there are capital upside due to its exposure to the Asian region, and turnarounds at PT XL Axiata Tbk and Celcom Axiata Bhd. Dividend is also expected to improve,” he said.As for Digi.Com Bhd and Maxis Bhd, Lee said, JF Apex has them on ‘hold’ “as their businesses are limited to local subscribers and dividends are not attractive”.Meanwhile, MIDF Research analyst, Martin Foo, said the government’s move to break TM’s monopoly in the broadband market is expected to intensify competition in this space.“Tenaga Nasional Bhd is said to be launching its broadband package offering in January. We expect the new offering will be competitive to existing Unifi’s offerings with the aim to gain market share.“Besides, there were news which reported that several foreign broadband players have expressed their interests to venture into Malaysia, so not much of good news, and average revenue per user is not expected to be good as well due to the MSAP (mandatory standard on access pricing). So TM has to adjust to the new environment in 2019,” he said.MSAP is a price ceiling that wholesale network providers can charge other telco players who seek access to high speed broadband.Foo said while MNOs’ input cost is less with the MSAP, their share prices remain under pressure because of continuous competition — which is especially true for DiGi, as competition is more intense at the lower price range segment, where price sensitivity is higher.“DiGi and U Mobile Sdn Bhd will see their competition intensify. For Maxis and Celcom Axiata, they are aiming for the upmarkets, with different price points, [so] their impact is lower.“Having said that, our top pick is still DiGi. Because of the affordability of their packages, we believe they could attract more subscribers to their postpaid segment, while prepaid remains tough. Overall, we forecast earnings growth for all telco players, except for TM,” said Foo.Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Tan J Young said the telco industry should be muted in 2019 due to the lack of positive catalysts.Tan’s top pick is Time dotCom Bhd, as he views the stock as having the steadiest performance by declining the least in 2018.Unlike TM, Tan said Time dotCom is not as negatively affected by the MSAP as it is not an access provider to rivals in the retail market.“As such, price pressure should not be intense. On the contrary, the cellular companies (cellcos) should be trumpeting this move (MSAP implementation) as a cost-effective wholesale fibre would allow cellcos to reduce expenditure on backhaul high-speed transmission — a paramount ingredient for the success of fourth generation and beyond,” he said.In his note to investors in December, Maybank IB Research analyst Tan Chi Wei said the main downside risk for MNOs revolves around the emergence of a serious price war, particularly if one of the Big Three — Maxis, Digi and Celcom Axiata — starts to reduce prices significantly.“Meanwhile, regulatory scrutiny would likely shift towards the mobile space, where we believe the overall regulatory pressure would be substantially more benign (relative to fixed line broadband).“[but] we think it is unlikely that the minister would exert downward pressure on price points, given that he has previously expressed his satisfaction with mobile price trends and competitive intensity,” he added.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/no-reprieve-seen-yet-telcos
"January 08, 2019 14:00 pm +08",TM,"Disappointments Of The Year: A year full of disappointments on Bursa ","IT has been a disappointing year for stocks on Bursa Malaysia, with more decliners than gainers. Here are the laggard sectors, with construction being the worst hit Construction hit by cancellations, defermentsThe construction sector was one of the worst-performing sectors on Bursa Malaysia, with most of the decline coming post-GE14 as the cancellation and deferment of contracts by the new administration affected approved and awarded rail jobs.Year to date (Dec 21), the Bursa Malaysia Construction Index has fallen more than 50%.Among the projects affected are the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail project, which will be deferred for two years, and the East Coast Rail Link, which was still under review at the time of writing.CIMB Equity Research analyst Sharizan Rosely says in a recent strategy report that the construction sector is likely to enter a downward cycle, given the subdued outlook for contract awards. He foresees a downside to the order books of the bigger contractors arising from the impact of the cost rationalisation of the light rail transit Line 3 (LRT3) and mass rapid transit Line 2 (MRT2), lower construction profit per annum arising from project delays and extensions of time and the risk of margin markdowns or provisions due to the substantial scaling down of the scope of some projects.“Our top big-cap ‘sell’ is Gamuda Bhd and top small- or mid-cap ‘sell’ calls are on Protasco Bhd and Salcon Bhd. Our top ‘buy’ is Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd for its overseas exposure, undemanding valuations and high return on equity,” Sharizan says.Affin Hwang Investment Bank Sdn Bhd is also cautious on the construction sector due to potential earnings risks from profit margin squeeze and reduction in contract values.Nonetheless, Affin Hwang analyst Loong Chee Wei says in his strategy report that most construction companies are now trading at sharp discounts to their revised net asset value.“The current weighted-average, sector-expected 2019 core price-earnings ratio of 11 times is reasonable, considering core 2019 expected earnings per share growth of 12% year on year,” he says, reiterating the investment bank’s “neutral” weighting on the sector.On the other hand, MIDF Equity Research has maintained a positive view on the sector despite the near-term swing in direction.“This was mainly a recognition of the stable development expenditure allocation in Budget 2019, continuation of mega projects — LRT3, MRT2 and Pan Borneo Highway, to name a few — and pending implementation of infrastructure projects, [including] the Coastal Road, Second Link Road and state water grid projects,” it says in its Dec 17 strategy report.It adds that some stocks are trading at attractive levels following the heavy selldown this year. They include Gabungan AQRS Bhd and Muhibbah Engineering. MIDF also has “buy” calls on Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd and KKB Engineering Bhd, which could benefit from the pending rollout of Sarawak infrastructure developments. Genting's luck runs out THE PH administration’s first budget delivered a major blow to Genting Malaysia Bhd with the first increase in gaming tax in 20 years. Genting Malaysia lost more than RM1.24 billion in market capitalisation in just a few minutes, shortly before Bursa’s closing bell, while its parent company, Genting Bhd, saw RM2.23 billion wiped off of its market cap. The selldown occurred after Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng announced that casino duties will be raised to 35% from 25% on gross gaming income and gaming machine duties to 30% from 20% on gross collection, as well as the increase of annual casino licence fees by RM30 million to RM150 million and machine dealer’s licence to RM50,000 from RM10,000 a year. Then, in November, Genting Malaysia announced that it was suing Fox Entertainment Group LLC and The Walt Disney Co for US$1 billion for terminating an agreement to develop a 20th Century Fox World theme park in Genting Highlands. This has led to uncertainty over the development of Genting Malaysia’s new outdoor theme park.And, if things were not bad enough, Genting Bhd’s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, which is developing the Resorts World Las Vegas property, has found itself entangled in a lawsuit with US-based casino operator Wynn Resorts Holdings LLC.Wynn Resorts is suing Resorts World Las Vegas LLC, a unit of Genting, on claims that the architectural design embodied in the Resorts World Las Vegas hotel and casino is substantially similar to Wynn Las Vegas, Encore and Wynn Macau.It is also worth noting that Genting Malaysia suffered its largest quarterly loss of RM1.49 billion for the third quarter ended Sept 30 (3QFY2018) due to an impairment on its investment in promissory notes issued by the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe for the development of an integrated gaming resort in Massachusetts, US.Amid the negative news and developments, Genting Malaysia and Genting have seen YTD declines of 44% and 30.1% respectively, based on their closing on Dec 21. E-government players hurt by change in governmentMY EG Services Bhd (MyEG) saw 29.8%, or RM2.78 billion, of its market capitalisation wiped out on May 14, the first trading day post-GE14, as companies seen as linked to the previous administration saw heavy selling pressure.It was the company’s largest decline in a single day since 2008. Adding to the pressure is the concern over the loss of income from its Goods and Services Tax (GST) monitoring project with the scrapping of the GST and the reintroduction of the Sales and Services Tax.While there was a recovery following the heavy selldown, MyEG’s share price came under selling pressure again this month following the decision to scrap the RM3.5 billion national immigration control system (SKIN) project. Prestariang Bhd was affected by the termination of the project, in which it holds a 70% stake. Its share price plunged more than 40% during the week the termination was announced, while the share prices of MyEG and Scicom (MSC) Bhd were also affected.Other e-government services providers include Dagang NeXchange Bhd (DNeX), Datasonic Group Bhd and Iris Corporation Bhd, which fell 5.2%, 8.4% and 6.5% respectively, on May 14.The average YTD decline of e-government services providers is 50.8%.Analysts have mixed views on the various e-government services providers. Most analysts covering MyEG continue to be positive on its prospects for 2019, despite seeing its share price fall by more than 50% YTD. In fact, six out of seven analysts covering it have a “buy” call on MyEG with only one calling a “sell”. Its average 12-month target price is RM1.82, indicating a potential upside of more than 100%.On the other hand, three of the analysts covering Prestaring have downgraded the company to “sell” with an average target price of 24 sen, indicating further downside to its current price of 35 sen per share.Analysts were more neutral on Datasonic with one “buy” and one “hold” recommendation with a 12-month average target price of 45 sen apiece, which is close to its closing price of 43 sen on Dec 21.DNeX was also favoured by analysts, with all three having a “buy” call with an average target price of 41 sen, indicating a potential upside of 86.4%. Regulatory pressure and competitive market hurt telcosTHE telecommunications (telco) sector came under pressure from both the regulators and a competitive market. In fact, it was so bad that Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) was removed from the FBM KLCI constituents in the year-end review after the sharp decline of its share price.YTD, the telco giant has dropped 56.5%, and has seen RM13.6 billion wiped off its market value — the biggest loss in market cap over one year since the 2008 global financial crisis, when more than RM27.5 billion was erased.The selldown was mainly due to the May 22 announcement by Minister of Communications and Multimedia Gobind Singh Deo that he would work towards improving broadband connections at lower prices. This led to an agreement by the country’s four key telcos TM, Maxis Bhd, TIME dotCom Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd, on the mandatory standard on access pricing, which will result in lower fixed broadband prices.Being the largest fixed broadband market player, investors see TM as the company that will be impacted the most. There is also concern that the reform could put TM’s monopoly in the fixed broadband space at risk. This year, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) announced that it will be running a pilot project in Melaka to test the viability of providing broadband services through its fibre-optic network.Apart from that, changes in TM’s management team added to investor concerns. At the end of November, Imri Mokhtar was appointed acting group CEO, the third person to take the helm at TM this year, after Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazali Ramly resigned in June, followed by his successor Datuk Bazlan Osman’s resignation a few months later.Other telco players also found themselves under pressure in a competitive market. Axiata’s share price has fallen 28.2% YTD, while Digi.Com Bhd fell 11%. TIME dotCom was also down 9.8% while the best performer in the sector, Maxis, also saw a decline of 6.8%.Despite the sharp selldown, most analysts remain cautious on the sector’s earnings outlook for 2019.“We expect Maxis to report lower 2019 earnings after the termination of the U-Mobile RAN sharing agreement in late 2018. TM should see a steep earnings decline due to intensifying competition and lower broadband prices. Axiata should deliver the highest earnings growth due to a low base effect and operational improvement at its overseas entities, [though]macro headwinds may weigh on its overseas profitability,” Isaac Chow, an analyst at Affin Hwang says.Nonetheless, he maintains a “neutral” call on the sector, as the lacklustre earnings outlook is somewhat compensated for by the 4% yield. Oil and gas sector falls short of expectations as oil prices collapseEXPECTATIONS for the oil and gas industry, which had been tipped as a dark horse for 2018, were high for some fund managers at the start of the year, but optimism turned into volatility, and then panic going into the final quarter.The price of Brent crude had been on a steady upward trend until early October, when it reached its recent high of US$86.29 per barrel. However, it did not take long for the price to collapse and drop below the US$60 per barrel level to US$53.82 on Dec 21, on concerns over a weakening global economy and surging US crude output and falling stock prices.The decline continued despite the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and Russia-led allies agreeing to slash production.It is worth noting that most O&G counters on Bursa Malaysia were in the red, including Sapura Energy Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Velesto Energy Bhd and Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd. Dialog Group Bhd and Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd were among the few O&G players that managed to chalk up gains.YTD (Dec 21) Sapura Energy has fallen 57.8%, Bumi Armada, 79.1%, Velesto Energy, 42.6%, and Barakah Offshore by 84.5%. Dialog and Serba Dinamik recorded total returns of 20.7% and 15.6% respectively.Maybank Investment Bank Research analyst Liaw Thong Jung writes in a recent strategy report that the Opec+’s (comprising Opec and 14 non-Opec countries) latest pact to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan 1 will be closely monitored.“A strong compliance will shape 2019 positively. A break-up, or poor execution, will reverse all that and a volatile market will ensue. We estimate the oil price to average US$65 per barrel, a level that would instil confidence,” Liaw says, adding that Dialog and Yinson Holdings Bhd are his top “buy” calls in the sector. He is also calling a “buy” on Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd (MHB), Sapura Energy and Velesto Energy.Affin Hwang’s Tan Jianyuan agrees with Liaw that share prices in this space have mostly bottomed out, with a select few staging a recovery.“Based on consensus estimates, aggregate sector earnings will see a stronger 13% year-on-year growth in 2019 against our coverage universe of 14%, driven by a turnaround or recovery of a few ... companies like Sapura Energy, MISC Bhd, MHB and Velesto Energy. Risks to earnings lie in movement of the ringgit, oil prices and capital expenditure spending,” Tan says, adding that he has a “buy” call on Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd and Serba Dinamik. Plantations continue to underperformCRUDE palm oil (CPO) prices struggled near a three-year low of RM1,965 per metric ton (MT) in November, as the benchmark palm oil contract for January delivery hovered at RM1,972 per MT with rising inventories weighing on market and physical demand. On Dec 21, CPO futures were trading at RM2,157 per MT.This has weighed on the share prices of many plantation counters. FGV Holdings Bhd was one of the worst performers as it fell 55.9% YTD (Dec 21). IJM Plantations Bhd was down 47.7%, IOI Corp Bhd, 1%, and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd fell 1.3% during the same period.The Bursa Malaysia Plantation Index declined 13.8% YTD.Affin Hwang analyst Nadia Aquidah says the current low CPO price is unlikely to sustain in the first quarter of 2019 as world palm oil consumption is expected to exceed production as seasonal declines in production take hold, thus reducing stocks.“As we expect inventory levels to slowly decline with higher consumption and the export of palm oil products, we think CPO prices could improve in 2019 onwards to RM2,400 to RM2,500 per MT (from an estimated average of RM2,200 to RM2,250 for this year). Sector-wise, we maintain our “neutral” rating for the plantation sector,” Nadia says.Maybak Investment Bank analyst Ong Chee Ting agrees, saying in a report that the new threshold for Indonesia’s export tax is a possible game changer for the industry, which provides a more level playing field for Malaysian exporters.Ong adds that the El Niño climate cycle might make a comeback early next year, and could disrupt the soybean supply during South America’s ongoing planting season.“Our sector valuation remains fair, hence, our “neutral” weight. For a trade, investors can position themselves after an expected weak 4Q2018 results season in February 2019, ahead of a potential CPO price recovery in 2Q2019. However, longer-term investors should consider bottom fishing for bombed-out small- to mid-cap stocks as stock prices tend to mean-revert over the long run,” Ong says.Ivy Ng, at CIMB Equity, agrees with both, saying that CPO prices are expected to average RM2,400 per MT in 2019, higher than the first 11 months’ average price of RM2,267 in Malaysia.“We expect oil palm players to report a mixed earnings performance in 2019. We believe upstream planters with strong fresh fruit bunch output growth should report better earnings, driven by higher output and CPO prices. However, this will be partially offset by higher labour and fertiliser costs as well as depreciation charges,” Ng says in a report.   ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/disappointments-year-year-full-disappointments-bursa

Top Glove Corp Bhd, which became an FBM KLCI constituent in the index’s year-end review, also saw an impressive total return of 39% YTD. This was despite the glove manufacturer suing Adventa Capital Pte Ltd and two directors of Aspion Sdn Bhd — Low Chin Guan and Wong Chin Toh — for RM714.9 million on claims that the directors were in a conspiracy to defraud the company by tricking it into acquiring Aspion for RM1.37 billion. Recall that in January, Top Glove agreed to buy surgical glovemaker Aspion from Adventa Capital and pay for it in a combination of RM1.23 billion cash and RM137 million from the issuance of 20.51 million new Top Glove shares at RM6.68 apiece. In a conference call with analysts, Top Glove alleged that Aspion’s management distorted the company’s financial statements.The top losers on Bursa in 2018 were companies that were affected by some of the changes post-GE14.

They expect cost saving measures and stable asset quality to benefit the banks.On the flip side, some quarters are concerned about the slower economic growth that may impact banks’ earnings. Telekom Malaysia the casualty of low price broadbandTelekom Malaysia Bhd once a “must have” component stock in institutional fund managers’ portfolio has dropped from the list of constituent stocks after the jaw dropping fall on its share price.The share price took a nosedive after the implementation of mandatory standard on access pricing, which has resulted in lower fixed broadband prices.Telekom’s share price plunged 57% with RM13.6 billion lost in market capitalisation year-to-date. It closed at RM2.68 yesterday.Telekom was seen as the biggest casualty for the price cut as fixed broadband service is one of its core products. YTL Corp the high speed dropYTL Corp Bhd is another conglomerate that has been removed from KLCI component stock list. The government’s decision to shelve the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high speed rail project has put YTL Corp under heavy selling pressure. Worse still, the group suffered from margin squeeze that weighed on its earnings.YTL Corp’s share price was on downhill after GE14, declining 30% to 93 sen on May 30, from RM1.33 on May 8. The counter rebounded in the following months but had maintained its downtrend to close at RM1.02 sen on Dec 27. Free fall on AstroMalaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC)’s approval for the live broadcast of the 2018 World Cup for free on RTM sparked fierce selling on Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd.The stock tumbled to all-time low of RM1.11 on Nov 28 versus RM2.47 on Dec 29, 2017. Year-to-date, the counter has dropped 46% to RM1.33 yesterday, translating to a RM6.94 billion decline in market capitalisation.Consequently, its two substantial shareholders — Ananda Krishnan and Khazanah Nasional Bhd — saw their investment values shrunk by RM2.81 billion and RM1.42 billion this year respectively.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/alltime-highs-twoyear-lows

"December 20, 2018 10:32 am +08",TM,"Regulatory overhang key risk to telco sector","Telecommunications sector
Maintain neutral on the sector: Regulatory overhang remains a key sector risk, highlighted by the Pakatan Harapan government’s commitment to resume the former government’s agenda to “double the speed at half the price”.The new Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) chairman, Al-Ishsal Ishak, who was appointed on Oct 1 this year, has warned that he would ensure the government’s objective to provide high-speed broadband nationwide is achieved with some operators likely to be reprimanded over regulatory breaches.Additionally, the government’s intention to reduce Khazanah Nasional’s holdings in government-linked companies (GLCs) casts shadows of a share overhang.The impact of lower fixed broadband average revenue per user (Arpu)s has been deferred to fourth quarter of financial year 2018 (4QFY18). Even though Telekom Malaysia (TM)’s 3QFY18 results showed a surprisingly resilient unifi Arpu, we do not expect this segment to defy gravity with the almost 40% price cut in its 30Mbps plan to RM79 per month, which was announced in early July and expected to be gradually implemented by the end of this year.As such, we expect customers’ gradual migration towards the more affordable government-mandated plans to substantively cut TM’s immediate earnings.With Maxis riding along with TM’s price cuts, we expect lower margins from fixed broadband, as forewarned by Time DotCom chief executive officer despite registering a strong 3QFY18 performance.As revenue growth increasingly faces headwinds, telcos are increasingly focused on higher value customers, optimising existing assets and drive cost efficiencies via lower tower rental reversion rates, single supplier sourcing for bulk discounts and digitalisation initiatives.Overall, 3Q18 mobile subscribers declined 177,000 quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) and 781,000 year-on-year (y-o-y) to 32 million primarily in the prepaid segment amid tight competition and ongoing SIM consolidation.Since the beginning of this year, Celcom registered the largest decline of 316,000 followed by Maxis’ 120,000. DiGi managed to grow by 57,000 as post-paid accretion more than offset the prepaid loss.However, cumulative nine months of 2018 sector revenue was flattish as the decline in prepaid subscribers was offset by the higher value post-paid segment, which expanded by 155,000 q-o-q and 406,000 y-o-y in 3Q18 to 8.7 million.A sector rerating requires catalysts for stronger revenue growth prospects demonstrated by subscriber, Arpu and margin expansions.As the global landscape for rapid data trajectory is driven by lower price plans and increasingly expensive capital expenditure rollouts to provide wider fixed broadband and 4G capabilities, coverage and service quality, any significant organic revenue or margin growth improvement is unlikely over the next 12 months.We maintain a “neutral” call given the continued intense competition in both the mobile and fixed broadband markets. — AmInvestment Bank, Dec 19",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/regulatory-overhang-key-risk-telco-sector
"December 19, 2018 15:00 pm +08",TM,"Green Packet looking at breaking even ","BLEEDING red ink in all but one year in the last decade, the inevitable question for the management of Green Packet Bhd is a simple one: When does the group expect to return to profitability?Widely known as the technology developer of WiMAX software solutions, Green Packet founded wireless broadband provider Packet One Networks (M) Sdn Bhd (P1), now known as Webe Digital Sdn Bhd.Loss-making P1 was generally perceived as a burden on Green Packet over the years as it rapidly burnt cash to build new infrastructure, dragging down the latter’s bottom line. Green Packet registered total losses of over RM1 billion between its financial years ended Dec 31, 2008 (FY2008), and FY2017.It did eke out a profit of RM70.66 million in FY2016 but that was just a drop in an ocean of red. FY2016 marked its first return to the black since 2008 because of the cessation of equity-accounting of share of losses in an associate company as Webe was no longer one from July 2016.Although Green Packet has been paring its majority stake in Webe — then known as P1 — by selling to Telekom Malaysia Bhd since September 2014, it still owns 18.9% of the company.Green Packet’s turnaround in FY2016 was short-lived as the group slipped back into the red a year later with a net loss of RM16.57 million, followed by a loss of RM31 million for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2018, on revenue of RM302 million. As at Sept 30 this year, the group’s total accumulated losses stood at RM464.33 million.According to Green Packet CEO and executive director Tan Kay Yen, the company aims to break even by FY2020. “Our priority is to expand our revenue and subsequently, improve our margins. But our long-term plan is to build recurring income,” he tells The Edge in an interview.Tan, who was appointed to Green Packet’s board on Oct 7, 2014, has more than 24 years of experience in sales, operations and management in the financial, IT, telecommunications and technology sectors.Green Packet’s present businesses are anchored in three key segments, namely communications, solutions as well as digital services, a new division that was started in FY2017.Tan says Webe is not within these three business segments as it is merely a passive investment for Green Packet. “We have seen a difference (following the paring of the majority stake in Webe) because there is no longer a top-line and bottom-line impact on the group.”Moving forward, Tan says the digital services division will be Green Packet’s new focus, although he acknowledges that this business segment will continue to be loss-making in FY2019 as it is still in investing mode.“Let me put it this way, once our digital services division breaks even, our group should break even too, that’s for sure. The other two segments (communications and solutions) should be profit-making in normal circumstances.”Green Packet’s bread-and-butter communications division offers services like Mobile Virtual Network Operator, mobile reload, games, video content, remittance and data bundles. It also operates one of the largest wholesale voice carriers for international voice traffic and mobile content distribution in Asia.“We have seen an improvement in the communications segment with a top-line growth of over 20% (in 3QFY2018) but this is a low-margin business. Although there is a margin squeeze, we will continue to expand revenue in this segment so that we can protect the bottom line.”As for the company’s solutions division, which comprises software and devices, Tan says it remains challenging as it made a loss after tax of RM3.25 million in 9MFY2018 compared with a profit after tax of RM1.86 million a year ago.This is the only business segment that saw a year-on-year decline in revenue — down a significant 62% to RM28.95 million in 9MFY2018.Under this division, Green Packet supplies indoor and outdoor devices for fixed and mobile wireless internet connectivity to cellular operators worldwide. It also customises devices for video broadcast operators and provides a platform for users to access content.The next growth engine for Green Packet will be its digital services division, which is made up of Internet-of-Things (IoT), financial technology (fintech) and media businesses. The group also owns 32% of locally listed G3 Global Bhd, which is a clothing retailer and IoT solutions provider.“We will be investing in the digital services segment until FY2019, which is why it will even out profits from the other two segments. All in all, at the operating level, we should be looking at break-even or slight profit soon,” Tan states.The drivers of the fintech initiative under its digital services division will be its newly launched apps kiplePark, kiplePay and kipleHome.kiplePark is essentially a cashless, ticketless and frictionless solution that enables the payment of parking fees via mobile phone for various types of parking services.“We have launched kiplePark at about 20 shopping malls and offices in the Klang Valley. Our next idea — licence plate recognition (LPR) — will come to fruition in two shopping malls in the Klang Valley towards January next year,” says Tan.LPR technology will change the whole parking experience, he contends, as shoppers can just drive into the mall, whereon the barrier gate will automatically open because the camera attached to it recognises a car by reading its licence plate.“You literally do not have to do anything. (As) for a parking ticket, you still need to pull out your wallet and cash or tap your card.”kiplePay is a platform for both consumers and merchants as it enables cashless transactions through a payment gateway (B2B) and e-wallet (B2C). “kiplePay is not an e-wallet for everybody but is meant for a certain community. We do not want to go into the red ocean space,” Tan remarks.kiplePay has been introduced in Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), whose students can use the app to pay for everything on campus, whether it is at the mamak shop, convenience store or bookshop.The third app is kipleHome, a platform and service that acts as a bridge between property management and residents as its features include managing visitors’ e-pass, bill payments, facility booking, private messaging and news announcements.“If I am staying in a gated housing area and I know you will be visiting me, I will send you a dynamic QR code for one-time use via WhatsApp. You don’t need to download the app. You just scan the QR code (and) the guard will know that I have authorised you to come in. You don’t have to give your licence or register (at the guardhouse).” ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/green-packet-looking-breaking-even

That gave a market breadth of 0.31 indicating the bears were in control,” it said.AllianceDBS Research said the market saw selling activity on Dec 18 with the benchmark index reaching a low of 1,626.93.It said the lower low did not come as a surprise because many market participants were concerned about the market development after the downside breakout of the 1,650 level on Dec 17.“This concern turned into anxiety which can be seen from the opening level of 1,628.47 that was close to the day’s low of 1,626.93.“This suggested a weak follow through selling pressure soon after the opening bell.“At the day’s low of 1,626.93, market participants were seen unwilling to be aggressive in their selling game because market had lost 51 points in 3 days measuring from the high of 1,677.91 (Dec 13) to the low of 1,626.93 (Dec 18),” it said.The research house said following the off day’s low down close on Dec 18, there should be buying attempt with immediate hurdle at 1,650.“The analysis of overall market action on Dec 18 revealed that buying power was stronger than selling pressure.“As such, FBMKLCI would likely trade above the 1,643.88 level on Dec 19,” said AllianceDBS Research.Based on corporate announcements and news flow yesterday, companies in focus today may include: FGV Holdings Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Transocean Holdings Bhd, Crescendo Corp Bhd, Comfort Gloves Bhd, Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd and Prestariang Bhd.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/klci-remain-lacklustre-immediate-hurdle-1650

On Nov 28, Mitsui agreed to buy 1.4 billion shares or a 16% stake in IHH from a unit of Khazanah for RM8.42 billion or RM6 a share, raising its holding to 32.9%. Khazanah’s stake will be reduced to 26.1%. The expected holdings are counted based on IHH’s enlarged share capital once IHH’s acquisition of 30% equity interest in Acibadem Saglik Yatirimlari Holdings A.S is completed. The transaction, which forms an important part of Khazanah’s portfolio restructuring, is subject to regulatory approvals and the completion of the Acibadem acquisition.The agreed price of RM6 a share was a 14.3% premium to its closing price of RM5.25 on Nov 28.

"December 17, 2018 09:07 am +08",TM,"Competitiveness lacking in manufacturing","KUALA LUMPUR: Canned pineapples, sugar and tobacco may seem to have little in common, but they are the products of Malaysia’s least competitive manufacturing industries.For the pineapple canning industry as well as sugar factories and refineries, there are only four firms or fewer that control the total output. This, said Universiti Utara Malaysia senior lecturer Muhammad Ridhuan Bos Abdullah, indicates that these industries are governed by perfect monopolies.Muhammad Ridhuan has undertaken a research analysing the concentration ratio (a ratio that indicates the size of a firm in relation to its industry) of manufacturing industries in Malaysia.Sectors such as tobacco manufacturing and the manufacture of rubber footwear were found to have a high concentration of output from the top four firms. (See table).The lack of competitiveness in the manufacturing sectors is not isolated to Malaysia. A 2014 report by the World Bank found that over half of the manufacturing industries lacked trade competitiveness.Muhammad Ridhuan acknowledged that some of the manufacturing industries had high barriers to entry due to their capital-intensive nature.That being said, his research shows a number of manufacturing industries with high levels of competitiveness, including rice milling, manufacturing of refined palm oil, and the manufacturing of motor vehicle parts and accessories.“My recommendation to policymakers is that they should look at [all] industries. [Find out] which ones are driven by technological innovation and those which, at the same time, [encourage] competition,” Muhammad Ridhuan told The Edge Financial Daily.Factors that may affect the concentration ratio include economies of scale, regulatory frameworks, and the industry’s size and life cycle, he said.The Competition Act 2010, which came into effect on Jan 1, 2012, appears to have had a positive impact. Between 2010 and 2015, there was a growth in the number of firms in competitive industries and a decline in non-competitive ones. (See table).According to Professor Dr Saadiah Mohamad, a member of the Malaysia Competition Commission (MyCC), the introduction of competition policies has been found to improve market efficiency, consumer welfare and, ultimately, economic growth.“These studies were not confined to Western economies, but also Japan, South Korea and other developing economies,” she said at the National Economic Outlook Conference organised by the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research last week. MyCC lacking in expertise, jurisdictionGoverned by the Competition Commission Act 2010, MyCC has the power to investigate and enforce the act on all companies, except in a number of “natural monopolies”, such as energy, aviation and upstream petroleum revenue, as well as multimedia and communications.Although MyCC has taken action in cases such as MyEG Services Bhd’s supply of foreign worker permits in 2016, its lack of action in relation to ride-sharing giant Grab’s merger with Uber’s Southeast Asian operations has been questioned.In contrast, Singapore’s competition regulator, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, fined both parties a total of S$13 million (close to RM40 million) in September, just six months after the merger was announced.According to Saadiah, the reason why Malaysia has been unable to take any action against the merger itself is because the law does not include provisions that empower MyCC to investigate mergers.“If there is evidence of the abuse of dominant positions, then the law provides for that, [and we] can investigate [the case],” she said.However, she noted that the advancement of digital technology had also been a challenge. “Competition authorities need to be well versed in the algorithms used to [price Grab’s services],” she said, adding that the man on the street may not be knowledgeable enough to file complaints regarding the ride-hailing firm’s pricing mechanism.Apart from private players, the competitiveness of government-linked companies (GLCs) must also be scrutinised, said Ali Salman, the chief executive officer of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs.“If GLCs are subject to competition, then I think they can be under government ownership and still perform. But Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) and Tenaga Nasional Bhd still receive some sort of protection from the government. That means they are not efficient in terms of market exposure,” he told The Edge Financial Daily.Ali acknowledged that certain government-backed firms serve the dual functions of supporting social welfare and delivering financial returns.However, comparing the investments made by national oil firm Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) and companies like Norway’s Equinor, a government-backed public listed company formerly known as Statoil, he noted that Petronas had filed fewer intellectual property rights than its peers.“We haven’t seen research and development to be very helpful for industrial growth, [in what is] otherwise a very good business environment,” he said.On the telecommunications scene, Malaysia ranks 74 out of 167 countries for fixed broadband services, according to the World Bank. It noted that the nation’s high-speed broadband prices are also relatively high compared with other countries.The bank attributed this to the fact that TM holds a significantly larger market share versus its peers in other countries.Meanwhile, Ali has compared the figures to Malaysia’s 15th ranking last year for ease of doing business, concluding that any analysis of GLCs operating in inefficient markets is restricted by a lack of opportunities for empirical analysis.“Because GLCs are not fully exposed to market factors, we cannot truly evaluate the efficiency and economic [effects] on them,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/competitiveness-lacking-manufacturing
"December 14, 2018 20:02 pm +08",TM,Methodology,"Membership of this elite group is automatic and complimentary for all companies listed on Bursa Malaysia as at March 31, 2018, with at least RM1 billion in market capitalisation. There are 170 members in the club this year.As recognition is the best reward for accomplishments, it is The Edge’s hope that the awards continue to encourage more companies to strive even harder for excellence.
THE AWARDS
The sectoral awards are:
The 17 categories are:
THE EDGE BRC SECTORAL CORPORATE AWARDSTo be eligible for the corporate awards, a BRC member must have been listed at least four calendar years before the end-March cut-off date in the current year, as companies are evaluated on their financial performance over three years.The methodology for the corporate awards is both stringent and transparent, with the results audited by Deloitte Malaysia. The data used to determine the companies that qualify for The Edge BRC membership and winners of The Edge BRC Corporate Awards is provided by Asia Analytica Data Sdn Bhd as well as extracted from Bloomberg.Members eligible for the Highest Return on Equity Over Three Years and Highest Growth in Profit After Tax Over Three Years awards must be profitable every year throughout the evaluation period. For this year, the evaluation period is from FY2014 to FY2017. Calculation for PAT growth is also subject to a risk-weight factor component to recognise the importance of consistency in profit delivery throughout the evaluation period.Winners for The Edge BRC Highest Returns to Shareholders award are judged purely based on total return, consisting of share price gains and dividends over a three-year period. The cut-off date this year was June 30.The annual end-March cut-off date for BRC membership was unchanged due to the need to source CR information for the judges’ consideration.Companies with scores within 0.5 point of each other are deemed to be of the same rank in determining the winner. There could, therefore, be cases of joint winners for the awards.
THE EDGE BRC BEST CR INITIATIVES AWARDEligible companies are evaluated by a panel of judges on their CR initiatives. The Edge BRC Best CR Initiatives award is presented to companies with the top average scores in three categories: Super Big Cap (companies with over RM40 billion in market capitalisation), Big Cap (companies with RM10 billion to RM40 billion in market capitalisation) and companies with less than RM10 billion market capitalisation. The panel is selected by The Edge and the evaluation criteria are based on the three focal areas spelt out by Bursa Malaysia’s Sustainability Reporting Guide for Public Listed Companies — economic, social and environmental. CR scores account for 30% of the evaluation for The Edge BRC Company of the Year award.

Here, value creation is reflected in the company’s market valuation, return to shareholders and stakeholders, revenue and profit growth as well as employment creation. To be chosen, the CEO must have achieved outstanding success in all these areas. Assessment starts from when the person became CEO of the company. The Edge has absolute discretion in deciding on this exclusive award and can choose not to name a winner — as was the case in 2011 and 2015.In 2010, the award went to Tan Sri Teh Hong Piow and Datuk Seri Nazir Razak for their outstanding contribution to their respective banking groups, Public Bank Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.In 2012, the recipients were AmBank Group founder and chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim and AirAsia Bhd co-founder and group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes.

"December 12, 2018 10:51 am +08",TM,"Market remained bearish","The FBM KLCI rebounded in the earlier part of the week but pulled back to settle almost unchanged in a week. Market performances globally were bearish last week, led by the US market. Furthermore, the ringgit got weaker towards the end of last week. However, the index was supported by telecommunications companies.The benchmark KLCI closed firm at 1,680.54 points last Friday from the previous week. The index continued to fall this week and closed at 1,652.63 points yesterday.Trading volume fell last week and this indicated that the market was being more cautious. The average daily trading volume declined to 2.3 billion shares from 2.8 billion in the previous week, while the average daily trading value fell to RM2.1 billion from RM3.6 billion.Market participation was mixed. Local institutions were net sellers. Net selling by local institutions was RM34.2 million, while net buying by local retailers and foreign institutions were RM34.2 million and RM2.9 million respectively.For the KLCI, gainers outpaced decliners eight to seven. Top gainers were Telekom Malaysia Bhd (+12% in a week to RM2.61), Axiata Group Bhd (+6.9% in a week to RM3.88) and Digi.Com Bhd (+5.9% to RM4.49). The top three decliners were Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-3.8% to RM13.70), PPB Group Bhd (-3.4% to RM17) and Nestle (M) Bhd (-3.3% to RM144.50).Markets closed generally lower except for China. In Asia, the decline was led by Japan’s Nikkei 225 index which fell 3% in a week. In Europe, Germany’s DAX and the UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell to a two-year low. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.5% in a week.The US dollar weakened against major currencies. The US dollar index rose to 96.7 points last Friday from 97.3 points at the end of the week before. The ringgit continued to strengthen to RM4.16 per US dollar, compared with RM4.18 in the previous week.Brent crude oil snapped an eight-week decline and rebounded last week as Opec cut production. The price rose 4.6% in a week to US$61.40 (RM256.65) per barrel last Friday. Commodity exchange gold increased 2.3% from the previous week to US$1,254.00 an ounce. Locally, crude palm oil fell 2% to RM1,998 last Friday.The KLCI is testing the immediate support level at 1,670 points after failing to rebound and test the resistance at 1,720 points. Chart-wise, the KLCI trend has remained bearish below the short-term 30-day moving average and the long-term 200-day moving average. Furthermore, the index has stayed below the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The expanding Cloud indicator downwards indicates that the bearish momentum is gaining traction.The Relative Strength Index and momentum oscillator have failed to climb above their mid-levels, and this indicates that the market still faces resistance. Furthermore, the moving average convergence divergence has almost fallen below its trigger line.A breakout of the KLCI above the resistance level of 1,720 points would indicate that the market is ready for a technical rebound but a breakout below the support level could mean a continuation of the bearish trend.However, the technical indicators on the chart favour a breakout to below the support line. So far this week, the index has fallen below the support line, and hence, the bearish trend is expected to continue towards the triangle pattern’s target of 1,610 points.The above commentary is solely used for educational purposes and is the writer’s point of view using technical analysis.

"December 11, 2018 16:00 pm +08",TM,"Fox and Disney’s ‘seller’s remorse’ adds to pressure on Genting Malaysia ","FOR Genting Malaysia Bhd, the saying that it never rains but it pours certainly rings true. Over the last two months, the Malaysian gaming juggernaut’s,   share price fell by more than 40% and that of its parent, Genting Bhd, dropped 18% as the bad news kept coming.And just when shareholders thought the worst was over, following a 10% hike in casino duties, Genting Malaysia announced that it was suing 21st Century Fox and its soon-to-be new owner, Walt Disney Co, for pulling out of an agreement for a Fox World theme park at its casino resort.Then, last Friday, Genting Malaysia posted a net loss of RM1.49 billion for the period ended Sept 30, 2018 — its first in 10 years. It saw a net loss of RM387.8 million in the quarter ended Dec 31, 2008.The group’s losses were mainly due to higher impairment on certain assets relating to the Malaysian operations, amounting to RM58.5 million, and an impairment of RM1.83 billion on its investment in promissory notes issued by the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe for the development of an integrated gaming resort in Massachusetts, the US.“The impairment loss was due to the uncertainty of recovery of the notes following the US government’s decision in September 2018 to have the land in trust for an integrated gaming resort development,” according to Genting Malaysia’s filing with Bursa Malaysia.Its parent, Genting, also slipped into the red with a net loss of RM275.8 million for the quarter ended Sept 30, compared to a net profit of RM190 million in 3QFY2017. However, it is worth noting that most analysts have cautioned on the potential impairment loss prior to the release of the financials.Analysts were disappointed by management’s refusal in a conference call last Friday to provide clarity on the status of the outdoor theme park (OTP) following Genting’s lawsuit against Fox and Disney.“I think most of us are really very disappointed as this is the most pressing matter at the moment. Management should be more transparent about the details of the issues related to the theme park,” an analyst says, adding that the lack of clarity is hardly a boost for investor confidence.Most research houses see the legal proceedings involving Disney and Fox as a negative surprise and slashed their earnings forecasts for Genting Malaysia and Genting as most had expected higher visitor arrivals to Genting Highlands in 2019 and 2020, with the opening of the theme park in the first half of next year. Recall that management had targeted to achieve 30 million visitor arrivals annually by 2020, with the OTP acting as a catalytic crowd-puller that would enhance casino visitation and overall spending in FY2019 and FY2020.Bloomberg data reveals that at least six analysts downgraded their target prices and recommendations for Genting Malaysia last month alone. Nonetheless, the consensus target price of RM3.83 is still 33.9% higher than its closing price last Friday.As for Genting, most analysts have maintained their recommendations with an average target price of RM9.23, indicating a potential return of 47% based on its closing price of RM6.28 on Friday.Maybank Investment Bank Research analyst Yin Shao Yang was the only analyst who upgraded his call on Genting Malaysia from “hold” to “buy” following the sharp decline in the share price. This was prior to the conference call on Friday.Yin says in his report that the current share price implies that the OTP investment has been written off. He adds that Genting Malaysia may even receive the OTP for free with spare change if it wins its US$1 billion claim.“Fox claimed US$46.2 million in accelerated payments but Genting Malaysia intends to claim for its OTP investment of US$750 million and consequential and punitive damages that, in total, will exceed US$1 billion. Although the theme park will no longer be Fox-branded, we understand that its construction will continue and it will eventually operate as an ‘in-house’ OTP. Recall that Genting Malaysia operated its own OTP before closing it in September 2013,” he says.A fund manager who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity tells The Edge that the impact from the Fox World theme park is not as significant as the increase in gaming duties on gross collections to 35%, as well as the increase of the annual casino licence fee by RM30 million to RM150 million and machine dealer’s licence to RM50,000 from RM10,000 a year.“While it is a loss not to have the first Fox-brand theme park in the world in Genting, the impact is not as severe. The theme park is unlikely to be the main revenue contributor to the group, even if it is Fox branded, and the whole idea is to increase visitor arrivals with the opening of the theme park.“So, while there is going to be some negative impact on the group’s earnings, Genting could still run the theme park on its own so it will not be a total loss for the company. And if it wins the case against Fox and Disney, it will get some compensation,” he says, adding that the legal proceedings could take some time but even a potential impairment of US$750 million from the OTP investment does not justify the sharp decline in share price.Genting Malaysia was the second worst performing stock for the week among the FBM KLCI component stocks, behind Telekom Malaysia Bhd, while Genting was the fourth worst performing stock for the week behind Axiata Group Bhd. Genting Malaysia’s share price has fallen 20.3% over the past week, as news of the lawsuit against Fox and Disney emerged, to a six-year low of RM2.84 before recovering somewhat to close at RM2.86 on Friday. Genting’s share price declined 8.9% to close the week at a three-year low of RM6.28.On whether Genting Malaysia’s downward trend has reversed, Hong Leong Investment Bank’s head of retail research Loui Low believes that there is stiff resistance in the range of RM2.90 to and RM3, despite a slight recovery seen on Friday.“There is no sign of a reversal yet as it (technical indicator) is still downward trending for the time being. Despite [being] oversold, it needs to surpass RM3 convincingly before the reversal would start.”As for Genting, he says it is still trending lower with no sign of reversal and the share price may even revisit RM6, followed by the next support at RM5.80.On a more positive note, Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau, tells The Edge that while Genting Malaysia and Genting could still face some downside pressure amid the negative sentiment involving high-profile companies such as Disney and Fox, investors with a longer-term view could look at the opportunities to buy the dip. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fox-and-disneys-sellers-remorse-adds-pressure-genting-malaysia

The cargo represents a value of US$7.82 million.FGV Trading is now claiming against TM Line and GMS Line for misdelivery of the cargo, as they have allegedly discharged and delivered the cargo without the production of original bills of lading, which FGV Trading said to date remains in its possession.As such, FGV said it is claiming the US$7.82 million, reflecting the value of the 11,764 tonnes of the cargo, along with an interest rate of 1.5% per month.FGV said the TM Line arbitration is not expected to have any operational impact on FGV and FGV Trading.But the two companies may see a financial impact if FG Trading fails in its action against GMS Line and TM Line.Shares in FGV fell two sen or 2.53% to 77 sen at today’s close, valuing the group at RM2.81 billion.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fgv-unit-starts-arbitration-proceedings-against-uranus-owner-tm-line

Maintain neutral: There were no major new post- or prepaid headline promotions from September to November but U Mobile Sdn Bhd’s GX50/30 unlimited plans (launched in mid-June) remained on the market. The industry’s mobile revenue for the third quarter of 2018 (3Q18) eased 0.5% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) (-1.2% year-on-year [y-o-y]). Maxis Bhd gained 0.4/1.4 percentage points q-o-q in mobile revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation market share to 38.9%/45.8% at Digi.Com Bhd’s and Celcom’s expense. We have stayed “neutral” on the Malaysian telco sector. 
At Digi’s retail shops, we saw some attractive limited-time offers, likely to counter competitive pressure on the lower-end segment. For now, the market is still largely stable, but we are watching if any of the big three telcos launch low-priced fixed speed unlimited plans.The international direct dialing segment was quiet, as only Maxis made a slight change to its mobile tariff (to Nepal).In reaction to package revisions of Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM)/Maxis and regulatory pressures, TIME dotCom Bhd offered its existing fibre home broadband subscribers for free two to five times of speed upgrades for the same price at end-September. Then, in October, TIME launched revised home fibre broadband plans priced at RM99/RM139 for 100Mbps/500Mbps, 34%/54% lower than before.The mobile industry’s service revenue eased a slight 0.5% q-o-q (-1.2% y-o-y) for 3Q18, after a decent 2Q18. Prepaid revenue resumed its downtrend, -3.1% q-o-q (-7.6% y-o-y). Post-paid revenue rose 2.4% q-o-q (+3.7% y-o-y) on greater net adding. As for the fixed line business, TM’s 3Q18 revenue was stable y-o-y and q-o-q.We have switched our top Malaysian telco pick from Digi to Axiata Group Bhd due to a strong earnings rebound in financial year 2019 forecast and a bigger upside to the share price for the latter. Malaysian telcos are trading at an 11% premium to the Asean average 2019 forecast enterprise value/operating free cash flow of 13.5 times, with decent 2018 to 2019 forecast yields of 3.5% to 3.8%. Downside risks include spectrum auctions for the 700MHz/2,600MHz, with higher-than-expected final prices and more intense competition. An upside risk is value creation from mergers and acquisitions. — CGSCIMB Research, Dec 6",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/telecom-sector-expected-be-stable

"December 04, 2018 16:00 pm +08",TM,"New TM chief facing Herculean task ","TELEKOM Malaysia Bhd group chief operating officer Shazril Imri Mokhtar, who resumed the role of acting group CEO on Nov 16 following the resignation of Datuk Bazlan Osman, is the third person to helm the hot seat this year.But with TM’s share price plummeting more than 60% so far this year, Imri — or anyone who fills the top spot — will be faced with the Herculean task of leading the telecommunications company, which is in a tight spot. Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo shows no sign of dialling down criticism of the telco for its high prices and poor customer satisfaction.When reporters asked Gobind at the parliament lobby last week if he would take responsibility for the decline in TM’s share price, the minister stood his ground. “I completely understand that it involves share prices. But at the end of the day, that does not mean a minister or a government official cannot ask any question or say anything.”One of the main concerns that Imri will have to address is the disparity between Unifi and Streamyx pricing in terms of megabits per second (Mbps). The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) has issued a statement saying that TM must rationalise the pricing disparity so that consumers are charged fairly.Recall that the recent reduction of wholesale broadband prices with the enforced Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing (MSAP) has led to a decline in the price of the Unifi package plan. While this is good for Unifi fibre customers, those who are still on Streamyx have been left out. For example, Streamyx’s 1Mbps plan costs RM110 per month while Unifi’s 100Mbps plan is RM129 per month.In response to The Edge’s questions on how TM, under Imri, will work together with the government, the telco says it will continue to play a major role in fulfilling Malaysians’ digital and communications needs and is in ongoing discussions with the government for a collaborative win-win approach to effectively address the connectivity issues faced by Streamyx customers, once and for all.“In order to do this, TM looks to accelerate discussions with the ministry and the MCMC to explore specific collaborative options, various fit-for-purpose technologies as well as optimising existing industry mechanisms in order to deliver a better broadband experience nationwide,” it adds.According to CIMB Investment Bank research analyst Foong Choong Chen, regulatory pressure remains on TM as the minister is trying to address issues such as Streamyx’s subscribers not being able to enjoy the revised fibre offers due to technical availability.Foong adds that some Home Streamyx subscribers may turn to other service providers or other technology platforms such as LTE (Long-Term Evolution) or LTE-A (Long Term Evolution-Advanced) wireless broadband.“Besides the 340,000 Home Streamyx subscribers that will be migrating to Unifi, we have assumed a churn of 40,000 Home Streamyx subscribers annually to other retail service providers … We have assumed the blended Streamyx ARPU (average revenue per user) stays at RM88 per month from financial year 2019 onwards,” Foong says in a Nov 5 report.In an earlier report, Affin Hwang Investment Bank research analyst Isaac Chow had pointed out the downside risk to Streamyx’s package prices with TM yet to make any reduction given the focus by the minister.Meanwhile, there is concern that the telco could face a more competitive landscape as the government has requested Tenaga Nasional Bhd to consider offering its fibre optic network to telcos to promote competition and choice. In September this year, TNB kick-started a pilot project in Jasin, Melaka, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The project aims to assess the technical, safety and commercial viability of using TNB’s existing infrastructure for internet connectivity.All these are happening at a time when TM is faced with competitive pricing in the fixed broadband space. While it is too early to judge how Imri will perform, one thing is for sure — he will have his work cut out for him. Speculation over Bazlan’s resignationThe market has been talking about the possibility of another round of government-linked company (GLC) shake-ups, and Bazlan’s departure has added fuel to the fire.Recall that following Pakatan Harapan’s victory in the 14th general election, many high-profile leaders at GLCs were replaced. Some of the big names included Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar and Tan Sri Azman Mokhtar. TM’s then managing director and group CEO, Datuk Seri Mohammed Shazalli Ramly, had also resigned from his positions in June due to “personal matter”.An investment head with a local asset management house says the market is speculating that Bazlan’s resignation is part of another round of GLC clean-up. “There is [also] talk of CEOs from two local banks leaving,” he says.It is worth noting that several names have been bandied about as potential candidates to fill the position of TM’s CEO, including Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd CEO Datuk Rohana Rozhan, who will be leaving the pay-TV operator come 2019, and former TM chief strategy officer Dr Farid Mohamed Sani.In response to The Edge’s enquiries on Bazlan’s resignation, TM says he tendered his resignation to “pursue other interests”. It adds that he will be staying until the end of February to facilitate the leadership transition and to ensure continuity.The telco says the appointment of Imri to replace Bazlan is a natural progression, and that the transition will be smooth with Bazlan’s continued guidance. “He (Imri) will be able to effectively execute the strategic initiatives planned to navigate the company through the current challenges and position us in a more resilient, competitive and sustainable footing.” Value emerge for TMMIDF Research head Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman believes TM is inching closer to an oversold position and its valuation — based on its forward enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EV/Ebitda) of 4.5 times — is much lower than some of the other telcos such as DiGi.Com Bhd (11.8 times) and TIME dotCom Bhd (11.0 times).According to him, TM deserves a better valuation considering that it has a larger fibre network than its peers.Is it the right time to buy TM’s shares?“I believe so … because the value is there, particularly for dividend yield hunters,” says Redza. However, he points out that sentiment is a bit negative at the moment with the issue of TM’s package pricing, resignation of senior management and interruption of services.“TM is at the 44th position in terms of market capitalisation size (and this is without imputing other factors such as liquidity and free float). So, talk of its exclusion from the FBM KLCI components, which is highly possible, has also added to the negative sentiment.“If TM is removed (from the FBM KLCI), this will result in further downward pressure on its price movement, although its financial fundamentals will not likely be adversely affected.”On the bright side, Redza says the telco has an advantage with the high speed broadband (HSBB 1 and 2) and sub-urban broadband (SUBB), which will give it a head start over competitors even if the government were to allow more competition.He believes the group could still monetise the available capacity of its fibre networks by selling them to major telcos, despite lagging behind in last-mile connection compared with other mobile players and TIME dotCom.“Despite these challenges, there is still value in the company. Dividend yield is rather attractive at above 5% and any increase in broadband penetration will likely benefit its wholesale business,” says Redza.While it is true that investors with a long-term investment horizon may want to give TM a second look, most analysts who cover the counter feel that it is too early to jump in. Bloomberg data shows that 10 out of 28 analysts have a “sell” call on the stock while another 14 have a “hold” call. Only four have a “buy” call.Affin’s Chow is one of the more pessimistic ones, with a “sell” call and a target price of RM2.25. CIMB’s Foong, meanwhile, has recommended investors to hold on to TM’s shares and has a target price of RM2.50. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/new-tm-chief-facing-herculean-task

Oil prices jumped more than 3 percent, it said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 243.98 points, or 0.96 percent, to 25,782.44, the S&P 500 gained 25.02 points, or 0.91 percent, to 2,785.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 88.86 points, or 1.21 percent, to 7,419.40, said Reuters.AllianceDBS Research in its evening edition Dec 3 said the FBM KLCI had on Dec 3 formed an inside day bar.It said under the persistent buying interest, the benchmark index was in the green throughout the trading sessions before settling near the day’s high at 1,699.72 (up 19.86 points or 1.18%).“In the broader market, gainers outnumbered losers with 568 stocks ending higher and 338 stocks finishing lower. That gave a market breadth of 1.68 indicating the bulls were in better control,” it said.AllianceDBS Research said the inside day bar indicated a pause in the game play with buyers and sellers seen in a balanced position.It said with the near day’s low close on Nov 30, the market was indeed in a good position to trade lower again in the subsequent day.“However, a buying attempt with an opening level of 5.88 points higher than last Friday’s close of 1,679.86 was initiated on Dec 3 in a hope to pull up the benchmark index from the immediate risk of another sell down.“Fortunately, the positive opening level attracted supportive buying interest which subsequently lifted the benchmark index into the 1,700 zone on an intraday basis.“An examination of the way this market carried itself on Nov 30 & Dec 3 revealed that buyers and sellers were battling for control of the game with benchmark index now likely to move between 1,677 and 1,703 in the coming few days,” it said.The research house said following the up close on Dec 3, there should be buying attempt with immediate support at 1,685.“The analysis of overall market action on Dec 3 revealed that buying power was stronger than selling pressure.“As such, the FBM KLCI would likely trade above the 1,700.67 level on Dec 4,” said AllianceDBS Research.Based on corporate announcements and news flows yesterday, stocks in focus today may include: Cycle & Carriage Bintang Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Reach Energy Bhd, Revenue Group Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, Hap Seng Consolidated Bhd, Signature International Bhd, Hovid Bhd and D’nonce Technology Bhd.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/global-rally-boost-klci-immediate-support-1685

In the balance is the chance to suspend the ongoing trade war.Investors will also be keeping a close eye on US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony on the economy before the Congress Committee on Dec 5 for greater clarity on whether the Fed’s rate-tightening cycle is almost done.Last Wednesday, the US dollar eased and investors sent stocks higher after Powell said the US policy rate was “just below” estimates that would be “neutral” for the economy. The Federal Open Market Committee is set to meet again on Dec 19, which may lead to the last rate hike for the year.Trump, who is strongly opposed to more rate hikes, as he is higher oil prices, may need to find ways to win brownie points to deal with politics at home after his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to making false statements to the US Congress about his efforts to pursue a Trump Tower deal in Russia. Trump, who called Cohen a liar, cited the seizure of Ukrainian naval ships as the reason for cancelling his planned meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit.Meanwhile, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) may arrive at a consensus to cut output to help support prices at a meeting in Vienna, Austria, on Dec 6. Brent crude oil fetched US$59 a barrel while the ringgit was at 4.1842 to the greenback at the time of writing.Then there is the ongoing debate on the Brexit plan and the still unknown outcome of Malaysia’s auction of the Equanimity — fugitive financier Jho Low’s former superyacht — that closed on Nov 28. In a Nov 29 statement, the government’s legal team said “interest [came] from around the world: Asia, Europe, Middle East, US. Many have visited the Equanimity for viewing”. It also said the Sheriff of the High Court of Malaya opened an unspecified number of bids in the presence of the legal team and Burgess, the central broker for the yacht sale, without saying if any of the bids were close to the confidential appraised value of Equanimity.“As with any purchase of property, several more steps need to be taken. The nature of the judicial sale process is to preserve the confidence of the bidders that their identities and offers will not be disclosed until the sale is completed … as the next step, the Sheriff will communicate with the bidders. The public, the government of Malaysia and the bidders all want a successful completion. So let us afford the confidentiality it deserves for this to happen,” its statement reads. No timeline for completion was mentioned.Statistical releases in Malaysia this week include exports and trade balance for October on Dec 5 and Bank Negara Malaysia’s international reserves as at end-November. Exports rose 6.7% in September, rebounding from -0.3% in August, and the trade surplus rose to RM15.3 billion. Economists will be watching for signs of trade gains from substitutions by multinationals from the US and China to bypass trade tariffs.Bank Negara reserves stood at US$102.1 billion as at mid-November, down 6.8% from US$109.5 billion as at end-April when the ringgit was stronger versus the greenback, but remain ample at 1.0 times short-term external debt and 7.7 months retained imports.The central bank’s short position in foreign exchange swaps, which had widened since April, reached US$22.79 billion at end-October or 22.4% of total foreign reserves of US$102.7 billion. This is higher than the previous high of US$19.1 billion or 19.9% of foreign reserves in April 2017, which was thereafter unwound to US$6.95 billion or 6.4% of foreign reserves in March 2018 when foreign selling receded earlier this year.In a Nov 30 release, Bank Negara says the US$22.79 billion short forward positions reflect its “management of ringgit liquidity in the money market” and excludes US$2.53 billion projected foreign currency inflows arising from interest income and the drawdown of project loans.“The only contingent short-term net drain on foreign currency assets is US$108.1 million government guarantees of foreign currency debt due within one year. There are no foreign currency loans with embedded options, no undrawn, unconditional credit lines provided by or to other central banks, international organisations, banks and other financial institutions. Bank Negara also does not engage in foreign currency options vis-à-vis ringgit,” it says.Investors will also know by Dec 6 whether Top Glove Corp Bhd will replace Telekom Malaysia Bhd as an FBM KLCI member following its semi-annual review.Companies having their respective annual general meeting this week include Scientex Bhd on Dec 5, and GD Express Carrier Bhd, MK Land Holdings Bhd and Gamuda Bhd on Dec 6.Global data releases this week include rate decisions by the Reserve Bank of Australia (Dec 4), the Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of India (both on Dec 5).

"December 03, 2018 08:12 am +08",TM,"Bears seen to roll into 2019","KUALA LUMPUR: There seems to be no respite for stock investors from the bearish pressure next year following the disappointing third-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Some notable disappointments in the latest round of earnings came from the gaming sector, with casino operator Genting Malaysia Bhd and its parent Genting Bhd suffering their first quarterly net loss in a decade of RM1.49 billion and RM275.8 million respectively, and that of number forecast operator Magnum Bhd its first quarterly net loss since its 2013 corporate exercise amounting to RM70.51 million.Things were no better for the telecommunications sector, where an impairment loss on its network assets dragged Telekom Malaysia Bhd down to post its first quarterly net loss in a decade, amounting to RM175.59 million.Meanwhile, the volatile commodity price plagued corporates, specifically the slump in crude palm oil (CPO) prices which impacted plantation counters while lower crude oil prices continued to be a bane for the oil and gas sector.Given this scenario, where do investors put their money in 2019? It will boil down to one’s own risk appetite, said Public Investment Bank’s (PublicInvest) head of research Ching Weng Jin.He is of the view that next year is going to be a challenging one, especially for those wishing to seek returns in Bursa Malaysia given the fact that there are still many uncertainties from an external standpoint.“Generally, the Malaysian stock market may start to look cheap, but the uncertainties from external factors such as the US-China trade war and its effect on global trade still persists, and with Malaysia being an open economy, it will not help if the trade war escalates,” he told The Edge Financial Daily.“Commodity prices have also been volatile. With Budget 2019 factored based on an oil price of US$70 (RM292.89) per barrel and given the government’s dependence on oil revenue, oil prices would be monitored quite closely.“So, unless investors can stomach this kind of volatility from an external front, at least in the first half of 2019 (1H19), things are not looking too promising for the Malaysian stock market,” he said.Ching qualifies that the decision to invest in the stock market boils down to investors’ sentiment.“Ultimately, the decision to invest in the market is whether you feel confident or not, so if externally the sentiment is affected, people will not be too gung-ho about the stock market. However, if factors are conducive domestically then people will have reason to buy,” he said.Looking at the FBM KLCI’s performance, MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman opined that the benchmark index is being weighed down by the decline in CPO prices, which have fallen 24% year to date (YTD) to RM1,759 per tonne, coupled with negative news on the gaming and telecommunications sectors.YTD, the KLCI fell 7% to close at 1,679.86 points last Friday.“These factors are likely to continue to affect the KLCI’s movement in the near to medium term,” he added. Silver lining amid gloomThere are some catalysts that may help spur the market next year, according to TA Securities chief investment officer Choo Swee Kwee.“One is the restructuring of government-linked companies (GLCs), both in terms of management and shareholdings in listed corporations. For example, Khazanah Nasional Bhd last week pared down its holdings in IHH Healthcare Bhd and we probably could see a lot more [to come] in 2019 for companies under Khazanah’s stable as well as that of other GLCs, and this is not surprising as the government has said they should lessen their involvement in businesses,” he said.Choo noted that restructuring in the power and telecommunications sectors could also provide some excitement for the stock market.“The private sector could also see some foreign direct investments as a catalyst. One thing that the (US-China) trade war issue has highlighted to businesses is that they cannot just rely on one country for their factory because if anytime the US targets a certain country [on trade disputes], and your factory is there, you end up being caught.“We probably could see some diversification of factories from China and other countries into Malaysia [if the trade war escalates]. Of course, Malaysia is not the only country to consider but it is a possibility due to the weak ringgit, which makes it cheaper for foreign investors.“Bear in mind that Malaysia has [one of] the best infrastructures in place among Southeast Asian countries,” said Choo.Inter-Pacific Asset Management chief executive officer Lim Tze Cheng is of the view that the announcement by the government in Budget 2019 that it will return RM37 billion in goods and services tax and income tax refunds to their rightful owners could be a positive indicator for the stock market in 2019.“The tax refunds to me was the most significant item of Budget 2019. In the past the country had been reporting strong gross domestic product numbers, but the reality on the ground was that [businesses] were not doing well. At least now we have a clear picture of what is happening, meaning that there was RM37 billion that had been taken out of the economic system in the past,” he said.“For a sizeable small to medium enterprise [for example], this could work out to an average of RM2 million in refunds, that had not been returned to them in the past.“So to me the government releasing this RM37 billion back [into the system] is a very positive move as this would go back to businesses and spur their working capital, and the ripple effect of this would be significant, hopefully this generates back some interest in the stock market and spurs the banking and consumer sectors” said Lim.Yesterday, Bloomberg also reported that US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to keep their trade war from escalating with a promise to halt the imposition of new tariffs for 90 days as the world’s two largest economies negotiate a lasting agreement.The truce between the US and China emerged after a highly anticipated dinner on Saturday between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Group of Twenty summit in Argentina. The leaders agreed to pause the introduction of new tariffs and intensify their trade talks, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was quoted as saying in the report. Will Bursa ever return to the 1990s era?According to analysts, investors should not expect the local bourse to return to the era in the early 1990s before the 1997 Asian financial crisis hit when the Bursa was a much more vibrant stock market than it is today in terms of investor’s interest.Fortress Capital Asset Management director Geoffrey Ng pointed out that the 1990s was an era where market and investor sophistication was less developed than today.“Retail investors at more than 50% of market participation [then] practised investing behaviour that favoured speculation and short-term price activity of stocks.“With higher institutional activity currently, fundamental investing and more efficient information dissemination mean that stock prices better reflect their true fundamentals,” he said.Brahmal Vasudevan — an active investor on Bursa who holds shares on the local stock exchange in his personal capacity, as well as via private equity firm Creador Sdn Bhd which he founded in 2011 and is chief executive officer — attributes the stock market vibrancy back in the 1990s to strong economic growth in the country which helped spur growth of the listed firms.“Hence our markets were active, [but] this was probably also fuelled by some degree of speculation. As the country matures the total market may not be as exciting but within this there will always be new interesting stories such as Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd and QL Resources Bhd which did exceptionally well in the last three years,” said Brahmal. Where are the bright spots on Bursa?PublicInvest’s Ching sees the banking sector as one of the few bright spots on Bursa next year. Banks recorded a decent performance earnings-wise in 3Q18.“While the banking sector is seen as a proxy to the economy, but as long as there is no major blow up in asset quality, the sector’s earnings will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace,” he said when asked whether the government’s forecast of a slower gross domestic product growth for 2019 could pose a downside risk to the banking sector.“In terms of relative valuations, banks are quite cheap at 11 to 12 times compared with the broader market, which is at 16 to 17 times,” he added Ching.MIDF’s Redza is also upbeat on the banking sector in 2019.“The banking sector is likely to exhibit a decent performance. While there are uncertainties on the geopolitical front, consumer staples and discretionary will also likely see some resilience, hence their still higher price-earnings multiples seen now, [particularly] for the food and beverage and gloves [sectors],” he said.Brahmal said Creador’s modus operandi on investing is to be “secular trend investors”.“Therefore, we focus on sectors with long-term growth stories. We believe that sectors such as value retailing will be a great sector for 2019. Consumers are looking for value for money and companies which are able to address this trend will ultimately do well. One compelling story is a company we have invested in called MR DIY which will likely undertake an initial public offering in late 2019,” he said.Disappointing corporate earnings have not helped valuations of the KLCI, which to a foreign investor is still an expensive buy at 18.5 times price-to-earnings ratio, a 54% premium to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.On the domestic front, things have not been any better.Recall that former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak had announced measures to boost lacklustre retail interest in the stock market in February this year including a six-month waiver of trading and clearing fees for new investors and exemption of stamp duty for three years for small- and mid-cap business.But the FTSE Bursa Malaysia MidS Cap Index, which comprises small and medium companies with a market capitalisation of RM200 million to RM2 billion, has declined by 28% YTD, suggesting that the measures did not really have much of an impact.It now remains to be seen if the new government can succeed in its plan to make Malaysia an “Asian tiger” once again where foreign investments start flowing into the country, and in the same breadth give the stock market a much-needed boost.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/bears-seen-roll-2019

Greenfield holds 30% equity interest in the ceramics and pottery manufacturer.Prior to Aminul’s entry, DWL saw the emergence of Wan Khalik Wan Muhammad as a substantial shareholder with a 10% stake through his private investment vehicle, Total Sejati Sdn Bhd. Wan Khalik served as the principal private secretary to the chief minister of Sarawak from 2013 to July 2018.DWL is strengthening its balance sheet by disposing of its property and land assets to raise cash for working capital. The group has entered into agreements that will raise at least RM22.4 million in cash.Meanwhile, Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd saw 17.75 million shares or a 2.5% stake cross on April 12 at 55 sen per share. Kenanga has not made any announcements on potential changes in shareholding.

Inventec acquired the shares from Lee Min Huat via a direct transaction at 15 sen per share. The acquisition gives Inventec a 5.2% stake in Scope, while Lee’s shareholding drops to 8.06%.Scope registered a lower net profit of RM1.46 million for the financial year ended June 30 (FY2018), compared with a net profit of RM4.55 million in FY2017. In the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2018, the group slipped into a net loss of RM432,000, compared with a net profit of RM1.01 million in the previous corresponding quarter.The largest off-market transaction was the disposal of 85 million Tenaga Nasional Bhd shares by its largest shareholder, Khazanah Nasional Bhd, on April 11.

"May 02, 2019 09:03 am +08",TENAGA,"Valuation needed for new houses — experts","KUALA LUMPUR: House buyers stand to benefit if primary market residential properties too, and not just secondary properties, are required to have a valuation done, say experts.Noting that new houses are currently priced at the sole discretion of developers, they said an independent valuation will help ensure fairer prices.They were commenting on the call for improved housing valuation methods by Khazanah Research Institute (KRI) in its report on the state of housing released last week.The report said the sales comparison approach (where the last transacted price of a house determines the value of a new comparable house in an area) currently used should be complemented with the cost approach (where the price is equal to the cost to build an equivalent property).“One of the weaknesses of the sales comparison approach is that the rapid escalation of house prices is sometimes the result of speculative activities,” it noted.Michael Kong, president of the Association of Valuers, Property Managers, Estate Agents and Property Consultants in the Private Sector, said the report seems to assume that developers are pricing their properties based on valuations done.“That is not true. Valuers are not involved in the developers’ pricing,” Kong told The Edge Financial Daily.He said overpricing occurs when primary market properties are sold at high prices, as developers have the sole discretion in determining the prices.A property sector analyst with an investment bank research house, who declined to be named, concurred with this view. She said the issue arises when the value of a unit of property at completion is lower than the initial price at its launch.This, she said, is due to the fact that the valuation method adopted by property developers to price their products is inconsistent with how valuers appraise the same unit if it were to be sold on the secondary market.“Malaysia has been fortunate as the House Price Index has been relatively stable and has been on an upward linear trajectory so far. So previously, homebuyers and investors who bought properties during its launching anticipated that they can at least sell the properties with 20% to 30% profit at completion. But the property market is soft now. It doesn’t work like that anymore,” said the analyst.“This disparity of valuation method between the primary and the secondary market is the crux of the issue,” she added in a phone interview.The analyst did not push for any particular valuation method to be adopted, but called for a standardised method that is endorsed by the government. This is so that the same valuation method is applied across the board.“This issue should be addressed through regulatory measures by the government. It doesn’t matter which method (is used), as long as it is consistent and comprehensive,” she said.The Valuation and Property Services Department (JPPH) has cautioned against adopting the cost approach for property valuation.“The cost method is a last resort ... because value is not equal to cost,” JPPH director Ahmad Zailan Azizuddin said last Friday at the launch of the National Property Information Centre’s (Napic) 2018 Property Market Report.According to Kong, Napic data may not be the best representation of Malaysian house prices as rebates and discounts offered by developers are often not captured in sales and purchase agreements, which are the data recorded by Napic.“This distorts official data on the property market,” he said.Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng, also speaking at the launch of the Napic report, stressed the need for a reduction in the gap between property valuations made by the public and private sectors.“I believe if there are clear SOPs (standard operating procedures), then the gap in property prices will not be so wide,” he said.Referring to KRI’s recommendation, the minister said the argument for the adoption of the cost valuation method needs to be discussed among stakeholders before a final decision can be made.Ahmad Zailan said the department routinely engages with surveyors and valuers in the private sector, and that while JPHH is concerned about the gap, it is “not too big.”“As a government valued (method), we adhere to standards. We share the same standards and principles as the private sector, but with a difference in opinion,” he said. Transparency needed on costsWhile Ahmad Zailan described property valuation as “both an art and a science”, KRI is quick to point out the difficulty in assessing the true costs of properties as stakeholders, including developers, have been reluctant to elaborate on their costs.Lee Heng Guie, executive director of the Socio-Economic Research Centre, said managing cost structures is often the competitive advantage of most developers, making it less likely that they would be willing to share such information.But KRI chairman Dr Nungsari Ahmad Radhi said “the real issue” is price discovery, as the prices of a developer’s new products depend very much on the valuation of sub-sale units in the surrounding area.“The [valuation] decision on one acre influences the next one … regardless of [development] cost. It becomes an auction,” Nungsari said during the launch of the KRI report.This is the key reason the think tank has recommended that an independent valuer be appointed for house purchases, not only during the application of bank loans but also to derive the true values of houses.According to Kong, the ease of obtaining bank facilities has also left developers unchecked.“Bank Negara Malaysia used to require developers to conduct market studies before banks could approve financing for their developments. Now that is no longer a compulsory practice. But the instructions should come from (the) banks,” he said.However, developers have often blamed high compliance costs for rising house prices, including the cost of building infrastructure for utility companies without being compensated.Datuk Soam Heng Choon, president of the Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association, referred to a case where a developer acquired a piece of land in Kuala Lumpur at a high cost.When the plan was submitted to the city council, it was imposed with RM24 million development charges, which translated to around RM30 per plot ratio or over RM300 per sq ft, Soam said at the KRI report launch.The KRI report, however, stated that limited data indicated both compliance and contribution costs are only a small fraction of total development costs, while costs caused by delays in development approvals have been addressed through improvements in the One-Stop Centre portal“Data from the Construction Industry Development Board and Napic indicate that house prices in Malaysia have almost doubled since 2008 while construction costs — labour, material and machinery, and equipment — have increased only slightly in the same period,” the report said.In fact, for affordable housing schemes, Housing and Local Government Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin said all the compliance costs have to be absorbed by the government agency responsible for the scheme. This includes the construction of utilities such as Telekom Malaysia Bhd communication infrastructure and Tenaga Nasional Bhd power stations.“There were concerns that the agency might not have the money to absorb the costs on their own, but I have talked to some of the developers and I have suggested that they incur the costs first and collect them later from the government because the government will be the one collecting the bills.“We will come up with a mechanism but whatever it is, we are trying to reduce the construction cost so that prices of houses will not be too high,” she told the media on Monday.“The property developers should not include compliance expenses in the construction cost to the price of the house for affordable housing,” she added. Government intervention a must for affordable housingZuraida said prices of affordable homes under the newly introduced National Affordable Housing Policy will be determined by taking into consideration the median income of a particular area, which could go as low as RM90,000 per unit and up to RM300,000.“We are going to monitor the prices of houses according to the median income of the area. So that is one form of control. Therefore, they (property developers) cannot go more than what the affordability rate of the people in that area,” she said.If the property developers do not follow the price guideline set by the ministry, Zuraida said those projects would not be approved.“With the median price, they (property developers) will have no choice but to follow (the guideline). If they don’t accept the median price, then I won’t give them the job, simple as that,” she stressed.When asked if this would interfere with the free market convention of demand and supply to determine the pricing, Zuraida said, “As far as the affordable homes are concerned, I don’t think it’s interference, because it is what we want to give to the people. But if [they’re] private [projects] then we are not concerned with how they price their properties.”According to JPPH’s Ahmad Zailan, the cost valuation approach may in fact be most practical for affordable housing developments.While he acknowledged that it is a challenge to secure the correct figures from parties that are currently not transparent with their costs, he believes that it is possible to succeed with firm government intervention.“There needs to be a strong policy,” Ahmad Zailan said.On the demand side, the finance minister has repeatedly called on banks to be more flexible in disbursing loans, even suggesting progressive interest rates on repayments for housing loans.“If borrowers are facing [payment] pressures, they can move to progressive payment schemes to pay more in later years,” he said.However, KRI highlighted that Malaysians’ high household debt of RM1.1 trillion or 88.4% of gross domestic product as at the end of 2016 largely comprises borrowings for house purchases. It also noted that the US sub-prime crisis showed that loans extended to people who cannot afford to pay for them are highly detrimental to the wider economy.“Against the backdrop of high debt levels, rises in property prices that are not supported by fundamentals can be a potential source of risk to financial stability,” KRI said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/valuation-needed-new-houses-%E2%80%94-experts

That implies a 10% to 16% return from Friday’s close.Malaysian stocks have bucked the global rally this year, losing more than 3% in 2019 while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 11%. An economic growth slowdown and uncertainty over the new administration’s policies led to US$4.4 billion of equity outflows in the past 12 months.Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has shown signs of moving away from his earlier budget-cutting stance to revive large state projects and seek foreign investments. Malaysia struck a deal with China to resume the East Coast Rail Link at a lower cost and revived the US$34 billion property and transport hub Bandar Malaysia.“Fiscal stimulus, per resurrection of ECRL and Bandar Malaysia projects, is returning, oil prices are exceeding target and liquidity is ample,” the bank said in the report. “Government policy-centric catalytic news flow alone could allow the KLCI to recover to 12-month highs of 1,850.”Macquarie expects similar developments to happen with MRT 3 and the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail project, as well as in the telecom sector and within the Petroliam Nasional Bhd group of companies.The KLCI is showing some signs of a revival. It climbed 1% last week, halting five straight weeks of declines, the longest stretch of losses since 2015.The main risk remains Malaysia’s potential exclusion from FTSE Russell’s World Government Bond Index, which could lead to US$23 billion of government bond outflows as other index providers follow suit and worsen foreign selling in the country’s equities, the bank said.The investment bank prefers “yield-resilient” plays, corporate banks, government-linked companies:",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysias-stock-market-might-turn-corner-soon-macquarie-says

Analysts attributed the rising uptrend and interest to a more concerted government push to boost the economy as well as abating external concerns over the US-China trade tensions.The FBM KLCI gained 10.6 points or 0.6% yesterday to 1,638 points for its second straight day of gains. The benchmark index has risen by almost 1% this week and market players are hopeful it can be sustained until the first quarter corporate reporting season.“There has been interest in the market over the past few days particularly in the beaten down stocks, especially banks and healthcare, as well as Tenaga Nasional Bhd,” MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman told The Edge Financial Daily over the phone.Mohd Redza said the rebound comes amid receding concerns about a potential cut to the overnight policy rate, which would have hurt bank earnings and dragged the index down as banking stocks account for the largest weightage on the FBM KLCI.He said of the 16 points increase so far this week, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and Public Bank Bhd, have collectively contributed six points.In addition, domestic macroeconomic figures are still showing “great” numbers, he said, pointing in particular to the consumer price index (CPI) which had been in the negative zone for two consecutive months, sparking concerns of a deflation. However, the CPI registered a marginal growth of 0.2% year-on-year in March.Mohd Redza said the CPI had finally breached the positive line, “as expected.”“But we had to halve the full year (CPI) forecast to 1.1%, since RON95 fuel is now stagnant at RM2.08 per litre,” he said.Hong Leong Investment Bank head of retail research Loui Low expects the KLCI rebound to be sustainable as news flow turns positive, coupled with higher crude oil prices.“Basically, we think the technical rebound should be sustainable because there is less negative news out there compared to the positive ones,” he said, pointing to the recent revival of the East Coast Rail Link and Bandar Malaysia mega infrastructure projects following a government review.“That bodes well for the construction related counters in terms of the trading activities at least for the near term. Also, the firmer crude oil prices are lifting sentiment too as well as [providing] more positive bias indicators at this juncture,” he said.What’s even more interesting, he pointed out, is the strength of trading volume which rocketed to 4.7 billion shares on Monday, 3.7 billion shares on Tuesday and 4.4 billion shares yesterday — well above the 2.7 billion average year-to-date until last Friday.“Value traded the last three trading days also went up to an average RM2.8 billion daily from RM2 billion daily between Jan 1 and April 19,” he noted.While Mohd Redza does not expect the increased trading volume to be sustainable, he expects the momentum to be sustained until next month when first quarter corporate earnings are announced.“We don’t expect corporate earnings to be spectacular because we had seen weakness in export numbers, (plus) long festive holidays and shutdowns, which have impacted distributive sales numbers during the quarter,” he said.As a result, GDP is projected to be lower, albeit still above 4%.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/trading-volume-market-improves

Management intends to continue to grow its home-shopping arm and further extend its reach in the local adex market to sustain revenue. The group has allocated more home-shopping slots in various channels other than the three full-fledged Go Shop channels. With only 1.8 million registered users for Go Shop versus Astro’s 5.7 million registered households, we believe this segment has much room to grow, driven by Star Power and Astro’s wide user penetration rate. Separately, citing sources online, TV is deemed as the most powerful adex medium, although digital advertising has been growing exponentially in recent years. Hence, the group is looking to reinvent Malaysia’s adex scene by leveraging its TV and digital data to advocate targeted advertising. We assume 13% and 5% y-o-y increases in FY20 Go Shop and adex revenues respectively. 
The National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan could increase Astro’s chances of bundling with other Internet service providers (ISPs) which will enable the group to monetise its large array of content. Recall that Astro and Tenaga Nasional Bhd on Jan 19 rolled out the bundling of broadband Internet and Family Pack channels for eligible residents in Jasin, Melaka, and management said it is also negotiating with other ISPs. We believe such bundles would limit the downside risk in Astro’s pay-TV segment as we see more NJOI customers upgrading to the new package amid cheaper offerings. We note that the initial consumer response in Jasin has been very encouraging.Albeit often touted as a major threat to Astro, over-the-top (OTT) holds a different proposition, in our view, as Malaysians still spend over 75% of their daily TV viewing on Astro’s vernacular content, and as we are doubtful that OTT platforms such as Netflix and iflix can completely replace satellite/cable TV in the foreseeable future given their limited capacity for live streaming.Piracy remains the main reason for Astro’s dwindling subscription revenue, with at least 29 illegal sites airing World Cup 2018. Positively, it was reported that Malaysia may follow Singapore’s proposal to ban the sale of media streaming boxes which pose a huge threat to the industry. We gather that the government may require ISPs to adopt dynamic ISP blocking in an effort to clamp down on piracy. With Astro often being Malaysia’s limited content buyer for major international events, management is hopeful the government will soon act to support the media sector.After a long delay, it is believed that the shutting down of free-to-air (FTA) TV’s analogue channels will be concluded in June in an effort to improve viewers’ experience. Moving forward, users will need to pay a one-off cost of about RM400 for set-top boxes for digital viewing. While MYTV is the broadcast service provider selected to spearhead the national digital terrestrial television  roll-out, we believe users might opt for Astro’s NJOI, which is also a free satellite-based TV service with more channels available versus FTA TV.FY19 adex dropped 4.8% y-o-y, while content cost increased 11.7% y-o-y owing to the second quarter of FY19’s (2QFY19) benign performance on the back of the World Cup and a tax holiday which lowered advertising activities. Positively, FY20 adex is expected to increase 5% with content cost normalising to 35% of TV revenue amid the absence of any sporting event and resumption of the tax regime. While financing cost would remain high as the weak ringgit has lifted the mark-to-market revaluation of the M3B transponder’s lease liability, Astro has started hedging 40% of its M3B transponder lease liabilities for the first time in 4QFY19. Note that the lease liabilities for M3B (satellite)(which contains 18 transponders) are still incurred in US dollars, while that for the M3 and M3A have been converted into ringgit.Astro is streamlining its operating costs (content, marketing and distribution, administrative and maintenance) through various cost rationalisation efforts, and it started to reap benefits in 3QFY19. We gather that the voluntary separation scheme exercise that was finalised in February would contribute net pre-tax savings of RM400 million a year starting FY20. Moreover, Astro has been actively renegotiating its content cost with key content providers due to the proliferation of piracy which has caused an array of content losing its exclusivity.We expect FY20 core net profit to rise 12% y-o-y on the back of normalisation of adex and content costs. Various cost rationalisation efforts will offset the structurally weak pay-TV demand. We also introduce our FY22 net profit forecasts. We maintain “hold” and our TP of RM1.50, implying 12.9 times FY21 forecast price-earnings ratio and 6.8 times enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, with an attractive dividend yield of 7.7%. The entry price is RM1.39. — UOB Kay Hian Research, April 17",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/astro-seen-advocate-targeted-advertising

"April 20, 2019 15:30 pm +08",TENAGA,"Cutting Edge: Thrilling, disruptive and game-changing","When Kamarul Muhamed decided to ditch his comfortable and well-paying accounting job almost two decades ago because it was too vanilla, he knew he was taking a huge risk. But he had to do it because he wanted to do something thrilling, disruptive and game-changing.It was definitely a risk worth taking. In 2014, Kamarul established Aerodyne, a drone-as-a-service (DAAS) company, with seed capital of just RM1 million. The business took off at an unprecedented rate and today, it has a presence in more than 20 countries, including Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, the UK and Saudi Arabia.With hard work and determination, Kamarul has managed to grow the company’s order book to more than RM400 million. And he is not stopping there. He wants Aerodyne to be Malaysia’s first tech unicorn by 2021 and plans to list the company the following year.“I know it is a tall order because there are currently no tech unicorns in the country. But we felt very strongly that we could achieve it, given our present growth rate,” says Kamarul.The company recently made the headlines because it was showcasing a prototype of a drone-concept vehicle — Vector — at the Langkawi InternationalMaritime and Aerospace Exhibition that was mistaken by some individuals for a flying car, giving rise to much hilarity, memes and misplaced wit. Kamarul was quick to point out that Vector was actually a drone-concept vehicle designed for carrying passengers, cargo delivery and surveillance purposes.When Aerodyne was founded, the drones were not used for their current purpose. Back in the mid-2000s, Kamarul had another company called DKM2, which was a full-fledged production house. The company had an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) division, which used drones to capture visuals for documentaries.“At the time, we were probably one of the pioneer production houses in Malaysia using drones for certain shots. After a long time, we thought about diversifying our business. Back then, our business was fun and profitable but we could not scale,” says Kamarul.“At the same time, we knew that drone technology had matured. So, we decided to shift our focus from visual to data. We turned our UAV division into a separate entity, pumped in seed capital and started Aerodyne.”The first year was slow. The team spent most of their time and resources on R&D. They had the end game — being an enterprise-level solution provider — in mind, but they were still figuring out how to make it work.Three months in, Malaysia’s east coast was hit by a devastating flood. Kamarul and his team got to work almost immediately, using the company’s drones to capture information and footage that could be shared with the public, government agencies and mainstream media at no cost. This propelled the company into the limelight. It received acknowledgment from various parties, including the Department of Civil Aviation.That experience taught the team that data is definitely the way to go. So, Aerodyne started offering its first commercial product — a project management and reporting solution for construction and property development companies called PRISM. Aiming at solving problems in construction such as delays and non-compliance, the business soared.“We developed PRISM from scratch. From day one, we established that we wanted an analytics-based solution. So, it was all about capturing data. Today, we have handled more than 50 domestic projects with a gross development value of RM80 billion,” says Kamarul.“These projects include Menara Warisan Merdeka and the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development project in Pengerang. Because we have all these long-term contracts, we are enjoying a nice cash flow every month. It is hard to believe that we started with only RM1 million.” Cost-saving solutionGradually, the Aerodyne team realised they had a bigger role to play — helping enterprises with their digital transformation. They began developing Verticality, an artificial intelligence-equipped asset management solution that could help large enterprises save about 20% of the cost of maintaining their assets.“Assets such as wind turbines. There are about 400,000 wind turbines globally,” says Kamarul.“Small turbines generate revenue of about US$400 per hour. Typically, operators need to shut them down for up to two days to inspect the blades, which leads to massive loss of opportunity. However, drones only take an hour to do this. With our technology, operators can repair their assets before problems arise, hence saving them a lot of money.”This is a new market focus for Aerodyne, following its 60% acquisition of AtSite, a Danish forerunner in wind turbine blade inspections for the wind turbine generation industry in Europe. Verticality can also be used in other industries such as telecommunications and infrastructure development, says Kamarul.In Malaysia, Aerodyne’s main client is edotco Group Sdn Bhd, an integrated telecommunications infrastructure services company, which owns about 29,000towers in the region. edotco is harnessing the company’s aerial capabilities to boost efficiency in its daily operations. This includes infrastructure site audits, routine preventive maintenance surveys, network assessments and monitoring for revenue assurance.“Traditionally, it would take more than a day to inspect a tower and another two months to churn out the report. Our drone takes an hour and the report is almost instantaneous,” says Kamarul.The company is also paying more attention to precision farming, that is, using technology to measure and manage variabilities such as yield, soil, pests and weeds across the fields to enhance efficiency and achieve optimum productivity, product quality and economic returns.“To do this, we use drones with multispectral sensors. The visible spectrum consists of only seven bands of colours. But there are actually hundreds of other bands that we cannot see with the naked eye, including ultraviolet and infrared. These invisible bands are actually very useful in determining the crop’s health,” says Kamarul.“Our advanced analysis can even help with disease prevention. For example, we can detect Ganoderma — which is known as cancer for plants — at a very early stage. So, farmers can commence early treatment to optimise their yield.”According to Aerodyne executive director Azita Azizan, the drones can conduct Normalised Difference Vegetation Index analysis, which is able to deduce which fields need more fertiliser and which need less. “We capture all this data and then let one of our agronomists analyse it to come up with actionable suggestions and plans. So, our clients do not have to spend more to employ a data scientist. We take care of everything for them.”Big enterprises such as developers and telecommunications tower owners may not mind paying for such services. But can the same be said about agriculture companies?Azita says it only takes some convincing as most companies appreciate the savings that come with the solution. For instance, fertilisers are expensive. If fertilisers are distributed optimally, the companies stand to save up to 20% per month, she points out.Kamarul is currently working out a profit-sharing scheme. “I know how much our clients are making a year. So, I can propose a profit-sharing scheme to help them gain 30% to 50% more profit. It will pay for my service and we will split the returns. Of course, I need to do this with full transparency. So, it is a work in progress,” he says.Most importantly, Aerodyne is able to offer automation — something very valuable in this day and age. “In powerline inspection, for example, we use thermal cameras to look at the temperature of the assets. High temperatures may mean the equipment is failing,” says Azita.“We capture more than 6,000 thermal data points per day. It would take an entire year for one person to process this data. So, companies would need to employ an entire team to do this. Whereas our algorithm automatically processes this data and does predictive analysis. We can deliver the report within a day.”The company hires subject-matter experts such as telecommunications engineers and remote-sensing experts to assist with solutions development, she says. “In fact, about 80% of the company’s employees are subject-matter experts.” Further expansionAerodyne is always looking to expand into new markets. Kamarul says that at any given time, there is at least one team dispatched to do proofs of concept for potential clients in markets such as Chile and Japan. He himself typically spends only a week in Malaysia each month. Most of the time, he is either attending events or meeting potential clients.“It is hard to believe that we only started looking at markets beyond Malaysia in March last year. Our first foreign market was Australia. We were surprised by the tremendous response. There are a lot of drone players over there, but our service is faster, cheaper and better,” says Kamarul.He truly believes that the “faster, cheaper and better” mantra is what sets the company apart from other DAAS players. “Recently, we were at a commercial UAV event in London and I met the CEO of a company about to close an asset management tender. He was surprised to learn about our solution and what was supposed to be a 15-minute conversation became a two-hourdiscussion. He called his tender committee and asked them to delay the tender awarding process because he wanted to give us a chance,” he says.Aerodyne was ranked No 7 out of the 200 global drone-operating service providers by Drone Industry Insights. And the CEO had already spoken to two of the higher ranked companies, but they were not delivering what he wanted.Since Aerodyne works with large enterprises, it is not always plain sailing, says Azita. “There is a lot of red tape, people to convince and stuff they need to take care of before they can migrate to our solution. TenagaNasional Bhd, for example, already had a team of contractors manually doing its asset management. Sometimes, companies cannot even confirm that they want to use our services after a year. We just have to be patient.”Aerodyne was self-funded for the first three years. This year, Kamarul realised that the company would need to make a quantum leap to invest more in R&D and expand more aggressively around the world. So, it completed its Series A round of funding with Axiata Digital Innovation Fund last month.He says Aerodyne could even go for an initial public offering if it wanted to, but he prefers to wait. “We want to get a better valuation before we make that big move.”",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cutting-edge-thrilling-disruptive-and-gamechanging

Volume was 765.56 million shares valued at RM295.89 million.The top losers included British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Allianz Malaysia Bhd, Tenaga, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, Maybank, FACB Industries Incorporated Bhd, Can-One Bhd and YNH Property Bhd.The actives included Sapura Energy Bhd, Key ASIC Bhd, Sterling Progress Bhd, Iskandar Waterfront City Bhd and Orion IXL Bhd.The gainers included Panasonic Manufacturing Malaysia Bhd, Pharmaniaga Bhd, Tasek Corp Bhd, Oriental Holdings Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Toyo Ink Group Bhd and LPI Capital Bhd.Asian share markets got off to a guarded start on Wednesday as investors waited anxiously for a raft of Chinese data that might show policy stimulus is finally gaining traction in the world's second-largest economy, according to Reuters.The main mover of the morning was the New Zealand dollar which dived after a weak reading on consumer price inflation stoked expectations for a cut in interest rates, it said.Hong Leong IB Research said that in the US, the market sentiment will be driven mainly by the ongoing US corporate earnings season and market participants will be on a lookout for outlook guidance for 2Q19 onwards.""Hence, should there be any negative management guidance in US corporates, it may [keep] a lid on Wall Street performances.

"April 16, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"IPOs of private companies to drive market rebound this year","IT has been another slow start to the year for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Malaysia, but investment bankers are anticipating a pickup in the coming months.In any event, they do not expect 2019 to be worse than 2018 when the IPO market suffered its worst year since Bursa Malaysia’s inception in 1973.RHB Investment Bank Bhd CEO Robert Huray, for one, anticipates an improvement in listings in the months ahead.“We can expect [some] good quality growth companies, both from the public and private sectors, going public in 2019,” he tells The Edge.Last year, the exchange saw only two listings on the Main Market of Bursa, namely Mi Equipment Holdings Bhd and Techbond Group Bhd. The total amount raised in IPOs also plunged 91% to RM633.12 million — the lowest in 20 years — compared with 2017’s RM7.38 billion.Astramina Advisory Sdn Bhd managing director Wong Muh Rong says investors are still uncertain about Malaysia’s policies and ministers publicly airing their differences do not help matters.She cited the recent outburst involving Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Redzuan Md Yusof’s rebuke of his colleague Yeo Bee Yin, the minister of energy, science, technology, environment and climate change, over rare earths mining company Lynas Corp Ltd.“These sort of matters should be addressed in-house at Cabinet meetings,” Wong observes.An investment banker points out that companies are holding back on IPOs as they are afraid that they will not get the valuations they desire. “Bursa has been one of the worse performers in Asia year to date.”YTD, the FBM KLCI has fallen 2.9% to close at 1,641.81 points last Friday.Nevertheless, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s remarks at the two-day Invest Malaysia conference last month, suggesting Putrajaya could be looking to list mature government-linked entities, have stirred up some interest in the IPO market.“If you want to excite the IPO market [with the listing of government-linked companies], let’s do a really good one. We must pick something that Malaysia is good at, and Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is one of them,” says Astramina’s Wong.“Petronas is already run like an international public listed company, so it will have little trouble finding investors and proving its value,” she adds.Three of its units — Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd and Petronas Dagangan Bhd — are already listed on Bursa, with their market capitalisation at RM72.8 billion, RM34.67 billion and RM24.84 billion respectively.However, a head of a local investment bank is sceptical of a public share sale of Petronas as the national oil company is considered a strategic asset to the government.Pointing to plans for the domestic and international listing of Saudi oil giant Aramco as well as China’s Sinopec Marketing Co, a subsidiary of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, Wong opines that a divestment of even a 30% to 40% stake would be sufficient to excite the IPO market.“The listing [of Petronas] may not be this year, but they can start working on the documentation for the IPO and then launch it once market conditions improve.”Wong expects more mergers and acquisitions and restructuring activities this year, but stresses, “We still need to see more progress in reform efforts by the [Pakatan Harapan-led] government after one year.”Investors are also keenly watching QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd’s IPO, which is set to be the country’s biggest listing since that of integrated petrochemical producer Lotte Chemical Titan Holding Bhd, which raised RM4 billion in July 2017.QSR’s largest shareholder, Johor Corp, is seeking to raise as much as RM2 billion from the IPO, which could value the company at some RM6 billion.Johor Corp president and CEO Datuk Kamaruzzaman Abu Kassim said last May that private equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) were looking to exit the fast-food operator.Initially slated for the first half of the year, the IPO may face further delays as its shareholders want higher valuations, a source close to the deal tells The Edge. The desire for richer valuations is telling, considering that QSR’s IPO has been planned since 2016.Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) data shows that QSR’s net profit grew 4.7% to RM192.59 million in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018), from RM183.95 million in FY2017. Revenue rose a marginal 1% to RM4.61 billion from RM4.56 billion in FY2017.According to investment bankers, the potential listing of other government-linked entities include Malayan Banking Bhd’s (Maybank) insurance arm Etiqa International Holdings Sdn Bhd (EIH), Axiata Group Bhd’s 62.37%-owned unit edotco Group Sdn Bhd, highway concessionaire Projek Lintasan Kota Holdings Sdn Bhd (Prolintas), Felcra Bhd and the Airport Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).It is understood that Maybank has started making preparations for a possible IPO of Etiqa, including seeking Bank Negara Malaysia’s approval.Maybank’s stake in Etiqa is parked under wholly-owned EIH, which has a 69.05% stake in Maybank Ageas Holdings Bhd, while Brussels-based insurer Ageas NV holds the remaining equity interest.A listing of Etiqa would certainly appeal to the market given its relative size and pedigree. Although EIH’s net profit fell 9% year on year to RM700.84 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018, net interest income rose 6.4% y-o-y to RM1.16 billion last year.In an April report last year, CIMB Research pegged Etiqa’s market capitalisation upon listing at between RM5.3 billion and RM10.7 billion, based on a price-to-book value (P/BV) of 1.4 times to 2.8 times. It used Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga Bhd’s P/BV as a benchmark.Rumours of Maybank preparing to spin off and list Etiqa have been doing the rounds since 2016, however.At present, Etiqa is the clear leader in the general takaful segment with a market share of more than 50%. It ranks No 3 on the family takaful list, with a market share of 15%.“If you’re launching an IPO, you need to ensure that the company is market ready and the listing optimises the valuation for its shareholders,” says a senior director with a local investment bank, who declined to be named.“But there is liquidity on the side and investors are willing to pay for better assets. Personally, I’m thinking that more immediate [ones] could be things like the possible restructuring of Malaysia Airlines Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd because recent large-cap IPOs have disappointed.“I think the only one that possibly has the most traction could be the Airport REIT,” the senior director adds.Under Budget 2019, the government, being the asset owner of almost all commercial airports in Malaysia, had proposed to set up the world’s first Airport REIT. It had set a target of raising RM4 billion by selling a 30% stake in the REIT to private investment institutions.However, last November, the Malaysian Aviation Commission pointed out that the Airport REIT exercise will only be carried out after the regulated asset base framework and the user fee structure have been negotiated and finalised between the government and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd. That is slated to be completed this year.The idea to list Prolintas was first mooted in March 2017 by then Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) group chairman Tan Sri Abdul Wahid Omar, who had set an end-2018 to early 2019 target.However, investment bankers say a flotation of Prolintas, wholly owned by PNB, is unlikely to take place this year as the government needs to sort out its privatisation policy for highway tolls first.Based on SSM data, the highway concessionaire has been posting losses for the past five years, which widened to RM100.1 million in FY2017 compared with RM31.38 million in FY2016. Revenue, however, rose 58% y-o-y to RM317.41 million in FY2017.Thus, most investment bankers are of the view that the IPOs coming to market this year will be heavily geared towards private companies rather than government-linked entities. Big IPOs on the horizon are family-owned poultry group Leong Hup International Bhd and MR.DIY, the country’s biggest home improvement retailer.According to news reports, Leong Hup is looking to raise as much as US$600 million (RM2.49 billion) and MR.DIY, RM1.5 billion.Leong Hup posted a 7.5% y-o-y fall in net profit to RM247.41 million in FY2017, on a 4.6% rise in revenue to RM5.5 billion. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ipos-private-companies-drive-market-rebound-year

The local bourse reacted positively to the announcement by gaining for the first time in three days to settle at 1,630 points on Friday,” he said.On a year-to-date basis, foreign funds have sold RM2.05 billion net of local equities, placing Malaysia as the nation with the largest foreign net outflow among the four Asean markets that MIDF Research monitors.“Meanwhile, among the seven Asian markets we track, India is the nation with the largest foreign net inflow worth more than US$8.5 billion or RM30 billion as the general election held in phases had begun in the republic,” he said.Worldwide, Adam said most equity markets remained mixed last week as some Asian markets prepared to head to the polls.Brent crude oil price, meanwhile, remained strong at above US$70 per barrel throughout the whole of last week, marking its third straight week of gains. The support for Brent crude oil price, mainly came from the falling Opec production in addition to the supply disruptions in Libya and Venezuela, said Adam.In Asia, offshore funds continued to make their way into markets here for the fifth week running.“Based on the provisional aggregate data for the seven Asian exchanges that we track, investors classified as “foreign” bought US$1.72 billion net last week, the 12th time that the weekly foreign net inflow reached above US$1 billion this year,” he added.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/foreign-selling-took-breather-last-week

(April 12, RM12.28)
Upgrade to trading buy with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM14.12. Bloomberg reported that Khazanah Nasional Bhd has sold 85 million shares in Tenaga Nasional (TNB) at RM12.33 per share. 
Following this, TNB’s share price fell by as much as 6% last Thursday, before settling at -4%. Year to date (YTD), it has contracted by 21.2%, largely due to lower rate of return on regulated asset base (RAB) of 7.3% set in the second regulatory period (2018-2020), compared with 7.5% in the first regulatory period (2015-2017).While the incentive-based regulation (IBR) framework would cap the return on TNB’s regulated assets, we believe its profitability could still be improved through cost efficiency and higher return on its non-regulated assets (NRA). We are maintaining our earnings forecasts with an unchanged discounted cash flow-based TP of RM14.12. Although Thursday’s sentiment was dragged by news of Khazanah’s disposal, TNB’s fundamentals remain unaffected and hence, we see the weakness in share price as a good opportunity to accumulate.Our TP implies an upside potential of 17% and therefore, we upgrade our call from “neutral” to “trading buy”. Also note that at current market price, TNB’s dividend yield of 4% looks attractive.TNB announced that Khazanah has disposed of 85 million of shares last Thursday. This accounted for only a 1.5% stake in TNB, resulting in Khazanah’s shareholding falling to 27.27%, from 28.76% previously. Khazanah remains the single-largest shareholder of TNB.According to Bloomberg, the disposal of shares by Khazanah was worth about RM1 billion at a price of RM12.33 per share. This represents a 2% discount to its last closing price of RM12.58. Although we believe the disposal is part of asset value realisation by Khazanah, TNB remains a strategic holding of the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.The share price has contracted by 21.2% YTD, largely due to lower rate of return on RAB of 7.3%. Given that TNB’s market capitalisation has declined by RM18.5 billion or 21.2% YTD, compared to a loss in revenue of about RM640 million in financial year 2018 (FY18), we feel the selldown is over-rated.Under the IBR framework, any price adjustment on fuel and generation costs from the parameters set on its base tariff will be passed on to consumers under imbalance cost pass-through mechanism for every six months. For the upcoming review in June 2019, we believe there is less pressure to hike the base tariff on residential customers due to the falling coal prices.In any case, we believe there is still remaining funds available (we estimate the savings are close to RM1 billion, after including the excess revenue collected from FY18) in the Kumpulan Wang Industri Elektrik to be used to subsidise any residential customer surcharge. — PublicInvest Research, April 12",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/higher-profit-seen-tnb-cost-efficiency-better-nra-return
"April 15, 2019 08:46 am +08",TENAGA,"More to the sell-off in TNB than just Khazanah’s divestment","KUALA LUMPUR: Was the sell-off in Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s (TNB) shares last week overdone?The heavyweight blue chip slid to a three-year low last Thursday after its largest shareholder Khazanah Nasional Bhd placed out 85 million shares in the company at below market price.The 1.5% stake was sold at RM12.33 per share, or RM1.05 billion in total, which was at a 2% or 25 sen discount to the closing price of RM12.58 the day before. Khazanah still owns 27.27% of TNB after the placement.Share placements at a discounted price are not rare, especially for such a high-value transaction. Still, it did not go down well with the market. TNB’s share price lost ground, and the blue chip sank below the placement price once the news broke.The utility stock plunged 5.09% to its intraday low of RM11.94 last Thursday. The sharp fall dragged down the FBM KLCI to a more than two-year low that day.Noting that a discount is normal for such a sizeable share placement, some analysts said the discounted price does not necessarily reflect the fair valuation of the company.A local fund manager said the news might have given a good excuse to short-sell the utility stock, which may explain the temporary selldown.Indeed, TNB’s share price rebounded to RM12.28, it was the third-biggest gainer, in terms of value, on Bursa Malaysia last Friday. Still, the share price is lower than Khazanah’s placement price.All said, it is worth noting that TNB’s share price has been on the decline since October (the month when it released the third-quarter earnings), after it bounced back from the post-14th general election selldown across the board.Khazanah’s rationale for the placement aside, the wide disparity in the utility group’s valuations among analysts reflects the cautious sentiment.Some investment analysts have pegged the target price (TP) lower since the release of its annual earnings for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18) compared with six months ago. The lowest fair value is at RM10.70 while the highest is at RM16. The average TP among 20 analysts is at RM13.05. Year to date, the counter has retreated by 9.71% compared with a 3.57% decline in the KLCI.TNB’s lower returns under the 2018-2020 Regulatory Period (RP2), such as revenue cap policy and lower internal rate of return of 7.3% from 7.5% in RP1 2014-2017, are expected to have already been factored in.So what is the other concern, apart from share overhang as Khazanah may sell down more eventually? Industry reforms that may finally take place.In an interview with The Edge Malaysia weekly last year, Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change Minister Yeo Bee Yin, who has cancelled several power plant projects that were awarded through direct negotiation, commented that there should be more competition in the power sector, in which TNB practically holds a monopoly in both the transmission and distribution segments.“With the reactivation of the Malaysia Programme Office for Power Electricity Reform (MyPower) for the next three years to bring more competition into the utilities market, regulatory risk for TNB has heightened due to increasing uncertainty for its role in the sector,” said RHB Research analyst Lim Sin Kiat.The government, Lim said, could implement changes to the single buyer generation mechanism, power distribution, and a potential reduction in return on regulated assets (after 2020).“Nevertheless, we believe regulatory changes will reduce TNB’s role in the long run, whereby most of the areas currently controlled by the group [especially transmission and distribution] could be opened up to third parties — this would subsequently reduce TNB’s return on assets,” he commented.Yeo expects to share more details on a reform “that will give an implication in many, many years to come” by mid-2019.Should the government stick to its time frame and plan, the reforms in the power industry could happen in a matter of months. And that will be the one challenging task that the newly appointed chief executive officer Amir Hamzah Azizan, who takes over the baton from Datuk Seri Azman Mohd, has to face.If the transmission and distribution segments are opened up for competition, some quarters are of the view that this may lead to breaking up TNB, including listing of certain assets.TNB is also the single buyer for all electricity generated in the country.However, concerns over the impact of an industry reform “appear overly pessimistic and possibly misplaced”, Maybank IB Research analyst Tan Chi Wei said in a note dated April 5.In the note, Tan reiterated its “buy” call with unchanged TP of RM15.50 for TNB.“A commonly mooted reform is the possible introduction of retail competition, which would allow third parties into the ‘customer services’ segment.“The net operating profit after tax attributable to this segment is a mere RM20 million annually,” the analyst said. This is small compared with TNB’s FY18 core net profit of RM5.42 billion.“Another frequently mentioned reform is the possible migration towards a full ‘merchant market’ in the generation space where generators bid to produce electricity, thus theoretically driving down tariffs and lowering generation returns.“Technicalities aside, current generation returns (in-built into capacity payments) are effectively guaranteed upon fulfilment of availability (not generation) targets under the existing power purchase agreement (PPA) framework.“A premature dismantling of the PPA framework would require hefty compensation by the government,” Tan explained.As for the possibility of farming out of TNB’s distribution assets to third parties, Tan suggested that such action will require shareholders’ approval, in any case.Any risk to TNB’s long-term earnings stability will not bode well for the utility stock. While its overseas expansion plan and venture into renewable energy have yet to form a significant part of the group’s portfolio, the regulatory risks will probably be the focal point in the near future, at least.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/more-selloff-tnb-just-khazanahs-divestment
"April 14, 2019 14:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Lipper Fund Awards from Refinitiv: On the road to recovery","After a tumultuous 2018, local fund managers are relieved that the headwinds that impacted the financial markets are beginning to settle. Despite the slower-than-expected global growth and uncertainties due to geopolitical tensions, the outlook for 2019 is turning out to be much brighter, they tell Personal Wealth.For one, many events last year that caused uncertainty among investors have created some sweet spots. Asian equities and bonds are starting to look attractive following the sell-off in emerging markets.“Last year started on a wave of optimism over prospects of a synchronised global growth. Instead, it turned out to be one of divergent trends and increased geopolitical and economic uncertainty, which weighed heavily on financial markets,” says Jason Chong, CEO of Manulife Asset Management Services Bhd.“We believe that the many economic difficulties experienced last year are likely to be less problematic in 2019. The gradual progress in trade negotiations between China and the US is a hopeful sign.”The ongoing US-China trade tensions have dominated headlines over the past year, setting off a chain reaction in financial markets across the world. The World Bank predicts that global economic growth is expected to slow down a notch to 2.9% this year from 3% last year.However, as the US and China have shown that they are willing to negotiate to ease trade tensions, the difficulties experienced last year are less likely to exert serious downward pressure on stock markets, says Chong.Apart from the trade tiff, the world’s interest in Brexit has waned considerably as the UK’s negotiations with the EU drag on. Without a firm exit plan, it is anticipated that the UK will be the one to bear the brunt of the fallout.“We see economic growth in major regions re-converge at moderately lower levels, making the continuation of that growth more sustainable. Moderate, better balanced global growth will reduce concerns about inflation and interest rates, which will put less pressure on bond markets,” says Chong.While the negative effects of the trade tensions and other geopolitical events have not entirely passed and could still impact export-reliant Malaysia,  a number of favourable factors are expected to cushion the blows on the local equity and bond markets going forward, he says. “We are seeing fewer political events on a global level that could negatively impact the local market. The US Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike [pause] is certainly a welcome move.“Regionally and domestically, equity valuations have become more favourable as they are now below their historical mean and slightly above previous recession levels. We do not expect a meltdown like in the past, given the stronger fundamentals and enhanced quality of companies.“In addition, markets tend to react positively over the long term to newly elected leaders and we expect the same for Malaysia if the new government continues to deliver on its promises.”The 14th general election last year ended the ruling Barisan Nasional’s six-decade-long hold on the country and saw the Pakatan Harapan alliance take control of the federal government.From an equities perspective, Chong expects Malaysia to reap the benefits of certain global and domestic political actions. This could be a longer-term play as the country is increasingly being touted as an alternative base for US firms looking to move their supply chain away from China.“Domestically, the government’s planned restructuring of certain industries, such as the automotive, power, property, telecommunications, gaming, alcohol and tobacco sectors, coupled with its move towards Industry 4.0, could bring about interesting opportunities in these sectors,” says Chong. Regional equities to make a comebackPublic Mutual Bhd CEO Yeoh Kim Hong echoes Chong’s sentiment on equity markets. She says the markets are expected to perform better after the synchronised downturn last year. Most of them have already recovered from the severe battering they received, she points out.After previously spooking markets, the Fed decided to soften its approach to interest rates last month. The US central bank announced that the key interest rate was expected to hover near 2.4% until end-2019. This was three months after it said two hikes could be expected this year. The key interest rate is expected to reach 2.6% in 2020 and remain at that level until 2021, unless economic conditions in the US change significantly.“The Fed’s rate hikes in 2018 caused the US dollar to strengthen against regional currencies and foreign funds to withdraw from developing markets, which caused stock markets across the region to decline. However, with the recent change in its stance on interest rates, developing markets could see a return of fund flows, currency strength and upward rerating of valuations,” says Yeoh.“The less hawkish comments the Fed on interest rates as well as the progress in the US-China trade talks, with the extension of the 90-day trade truce from the March 1 deadline, are positive for market sentiment. A positive outcome of the trade talks and the US keeping interest rates stable or close to neutral will underpin market sentiment going forward.“As we could be near the end of the tightening interest rate upcycle in the US, the pressure on developing-market currencies is easing. This should result in better performances developing-market equities and bonds.”Yeoh says the valuations of US stocks are no longer as excessive and offer a dividend yield of about 2%. “There is room for positive rerating for regional markets such as China and Taiwan, which are currently trading at discounts of 9% and 6% to their historical long-term average price-earnings ratios, with dividend yields of about 4% respectively.”Hong Leong Asset Management Bhd CEO Hoo See Kheng too expects Asian equity markets to outperform, given that valuations have become cheap following last year’s sell-off. “Although growth is expected to be slower than last year’s, we expect corporate earnings growth in Asia to outpace that of developed markets.“In Asean, we favour Malaysia as most of the other countries [such as Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines] are expected to hold their general elections this year and the political uncertainty may be an overhang on these markets, whereas Malaysia emerged from its own general election last year.”But the wave of optimism is not an indication that the global markets are out of the woods. Affin Hwang Asset Management Bhd deputy managing director and chief investment officer David Ng sees two risks that the market seems to be complacent about.“First is the ongoing decline of US dollar liquidity as the Fed embarks on quantitative tightening. A decline in US dollar liquidity often leads to weaker US stock markets. And a sharp decline in US stock markets could reverberate regionally and drag down the other stock indices globally,” he warns.The second risk is taking for granted that the US central bank will not raise interest rates this year. Ng reminds investors that although the Fed is holding back on rate hikes for the time being, the world’s largest economy is doing well and its inflation rate could go up.“The market is now pricing in a pause in rate hikes for the rest of 2019. In our view, the US economy remains healthy and inflation could gradually rise. Thus, there is a fair chance that the Fed may resume rate hikes in the second half of this year. This may surprise the market and lead to pullbacks in the bond and equity markets,” he says. Malaysia’s steady growthOn the home front, economic growth is projected to be 4.5% in 2019 amid sustained domestic demand.Yeoh says that after the net outflow of RM11.6 billion from Bursa Malaysia last year, selling pressure from foreign investors is expected to ease. Thus, the local stock market may be positioned to trend higher if foreign markets continue to strengthen.“Valuations of [stocks on Bursa] are slightly higher than their 10-year average, with an average dividend yield of about 3.4%, which should underpin the market amid a stable interest rate outlook,” she says.The ringgit, which depreciated 2.1% to 4.13 against the US dollar last year, has improved to 4.08. Yeoh believes that the local currency will continue to be supported Malaysia’s current account surplus, the recovery in crude oil prices and return of foreign investments. “Following the ringgit’s recovery, investors have taken profit on export-oriented counters, which previously benefited from a weaker ringgit,” she says.But there is renewed interest in sectors that were impacted the weak local currency such as the automotive industry, says Yeoh. The government’s initiative to boost the local currency and the economy is expected to improve credit ratings and lead to a firmer ringgit, she adds.TA Investment Management Bhd CEO Wong Mien says the ringgit is bound to recover over the medium term. “As the new government is trying hard to restore the fiscal health of the country, we believe the ringgit could strengthen in the medium term. As the administration  is trying to reduce the budget deficit and start paying off its debts, we believe foreign investors will return to Malaysia.”Libra Invest Bhd fund manager Joy-Marina Choong Wai Kwin concurs, saying that the local economy is expected to grow steadily. Nevertheless, it may still face uncertainties, she warns, citing Bank Negara Malaysia’s concerns about downside risk as a result of the unresolved US-China trade negotiations.Domestic growth is still vulnerable to external factors such as crude oil prices, a strengthening US dollar, US interest rates and other geopolitical issues, says Choong.Given the current market conditions, Affin Hwang’s Ng warns investors of more turbulence ahead. “Reassess your risk profile and take the current market rebound to rethink your asset allocation. For example, if you find that you have too much exposure to equities when your risk tolerance is low or modest, it is prudent to reallocate a certain portion to lower-risk asset classes such as a bond or dividend fund. Stick to an asset allocation that matches your risk tolerance and stay diversified.”  Bullish on bondsLocal bonds are looking attractive as Bank Negara Malaysia appears to be holding back on raising interest rates for now. This comes as the US Federal Reserve signals that it is done with rate hikes for now, which gives other central banks the flexibility to pause their rate increases or ease policy rates.In the light of this, fund managers believe that Malaysian bonds are expected to do well as Bank Negara is under no compulsion to adjust its overnight policy rate (OPR). Libra Invest Bhd fund manager Joy-Marina Choong Wai Kwin says headline inflation is expected to stay low in the immediate term and remain broadly stable compared with last year.Given the expectations of moderate domestic growth amid benign inflation, there is no urgency for the central bank to raise interest rates in the near term. This is conducive for bond investments, says Choong. “We will continue to actively manage our fixed-income funds while maintaining focus on liquid, high-grade bond issuers with strong credit and stable long-term cash flow.”She recommends that investors look at Malaysian bond funds as domestic growth and inflation are expected to remain moderate. “The slower pace of new primary issuances in the local corporate bond market, especially in the AAA and AA-rated space, may continue to drive yields lower [and prices higher]. While financial markets may experience fluctuations from time to time, we always advocate that investors take a long-term approach towards their investments.“For the local bond market, given the challenging economic landscape, we continue to be overweight on sectors that are resilient to economic cycles — for example, the power sector. [This is mainly] due to its long-term, stable and predictable cash flow, the steady demand for electricity and the strong credit profile of the electricity off-taker — in this case, Tenaga Nasional Bhd.”Manulife Asset Management Services Bhd CEO Jason Chong believes that the risk-reward ratios in the local bond market are quite balanced in the medium term and corporate bonds could be the key driver of returns for fixed-income investors. “The Malaysian bond market is well supported ample domestic liquidity and real money demand. Coupled with expectations of more subdued economic growth and a benign inflation outlook, the OPR could remain unchanged in the early part of this year. We believe this presents an environment that is conducive for investing in bonds,” he says.However, the outlook for Malaysia’s long-term fiscal health remains a concern. The new government’s targets for the country’s fiscal deficit imply that there will be a longer timeline for fiscal consolidation efforts.This affects investor sentiment, says Chong. “In addition, potentially higher net supply of government bonds in the first half of this year may pose a slight drag to the market [although this could ease in the second half of the year as bond maturity increases]. On top of that, Malaysia’s higher reliance on oil-related revenue increases its vulnerability to global oil price movements, which could hinder the local bond market.“Against this backdrop, we see the market environment as neutral. We believe corporate bonds will remain an attractive asset class that offers higher returns with lower volatility. We expect credit spreads to remain tight as investors continue to chase yields amid the smaller supply of corporate bonds this year.”",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lipper-fund-awards-refinitiv-road-recovery

"April 10, 2019 16:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Lipper Fund Awards from Refinitiv: Libra Invest Bhd: Won two fund awards","Libra Invest Bhd won two awards at the 2019 Lipper Fund Awards from Refinitiv in the Bond MYR (Provident) three and five-year categories. These were the first wins for the Libra BondEXTRA fund, which was launched in 2002.The fund invests in ringgit-denominated bonds, with a focus on corporate bond issuers with strong financial metrics.Fund manager Joy-Marina Choong Wai Kwin credits the success to an active portfolio management strategy, as opposed to a buy-and-hold approach. According to her, the fixed-income team constantly monitors global economic data, capital flows and movements in the equity, fixed-income and currency markets to anticipate future market directions.“For individual bond selection, we place a strong emphasis on the credit strength of bond issuers, [including factors] such as consistent and visible cash flow, stringent bond structure and good corporate governance. We seek to diversify our investments across sectors and individual securities to mitigate the risk profile of the fund,” says Choong.One of the most challenging situations the team faced in the last few years was when Bank Negara Malaysia restricted transactions in the offshore ringgit non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets at end-2016. The central bank governor said at the time that activities in the ringgit NDF market had negatively impacted the onshore market. This decision resulted in a decline of offshore holdings in Malaysian Government Securities (MGS).“It subsequently dampened investor sentiment and resulted in a decline in trading volumes in the MGS and corporate bond markets. Nonetheless, the sentiment improved after Bank Negara announced a number of initiatives to improve liquidity in the domestic bond market in mid-2017, which included additional hedging flexibility for registered investors,” says Choong.The team weathered this period by managing the fund actively. It focused on liquid, high-grade bonds with strong credit and stable long-term cash flow since buying interest for such bonds remained strong, says Choong.In contrast, the uncertainties arising from the 14th general election last May did not impact the local bond market significantly as there was still solid demand from domestic investors. The reaffirmation of Malaysia’s sovereign credit rating by major credit rating agencies also lifted sentiment.“Overall, the corporate bond market performed well in 2018 as buying interest for selected AAA and AA-rated bonds continued to outstrip supply amid ample liquidity in the market. Similarly, given the fund’s focus on liquid, high-grade corporate bonds, its performance over the longer term remained relatively stable,” says Choong.In the past few years, two events influenced significant changes in the asset allocation of the fund. One was in 2016 when Bank Negara unexpectedly cut interest rates, citing risks from the UK’s exit from the EU. The team increased its holdings in selected corporate bonds to capitalise on strong buying interest in the local bond market at the time.“Towards end-2017, we rebalanced the portfolio in anticipation that the central bank may normalise interest rates in 2018,” says Choong.According to the fund’s fact sheet dated Jan 31, 2019, its biggest asset allocations were in power, industrial/manufacturing and transport. The allocations were guided by the challenging domestic landscape.“We are overweight on sectors that are resilient to economic cycles such as the power sector due to its long-term, stable and predictable cash flow, steady demand for electricity and the strong credit profile of the electricity ‘offtaker’ — Tenaga Nasional Bhd. We also place strong emphasis on the credit quality of issuers, with a greater focus on consistent and visible cash flows, stringent bond structure and good corporate governance,” says Choong.She expects the global growth momentum to moderate going forward, with the unresolved trade tensions and political uncertainties continuing to cloud the overall growth outlook. Malaysia’s growth prospects will similarly be affected by the heightened uncertainties.“Given the uncertainties ahead, we will stay vigilant and continuously monitor market developments on both the local and global fronts while remaining flexible in managing portfolio durations to respond to changes in the market environment. We will continue to manage the fund actively and maintain a focus on liquid, high-grade bonds with strong credit and stable long-term cash flow,” says Choong. — By Tan Zhai Yun",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lipper-fund-awards-refinitiv-libra-invest-bhd-won-two-fund-awards
"April 09, 2019 15:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Will lower LNG prices bring down local energy costs? ","FOR most of the first quarter, the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been languishing at less than US$3 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), lower than the past six-month average of US$3.30.The low price was driven by the huge supply coming from Australia and the US, as well as lower-than-expected demand as winter in the northern hemisphere was less severe than initially anticipated.Industry observers say the situation is likely to persist, as US exports of natural gas are expected to reach nine billion standard cu ft (scf) per day this year, almost twice last year’s volume, according to projections by the US Energy Information Agency (EIA).“With the last of the eight major Australian projects built over the past decade coming onstream, and more volume becoming available from the US, the oversupply situation is likely to be amplified for the rest of 2019, at least in Asia,” says an observer.With supply from Australia and the US expected to remain high, LNG prices are expected to remain at the current low level for the rest of the year. The EIA forecasts that the natural gas price will average US$2.85 per mmBtu this year, some 30 US cents lower than last year.“The spot price for LNG delivered to Northeast Asian customers dropped to US$4.65 per mmBtu in the week to March 21, the lowest since May 2016. That is less than RM20 per mmBtu. Currently, the LNG tariff to non-power users is RM32.92 per mmBtu while power generators pay RM27.20 in Malaysia,” the observer says.This is a rare occasion that the regulated domestic piped gas price in Malaysia is higher than the international price.  This raises the question whether the government will cut the regulated gas price.Industry analysts and observers The Edge spoke to believe so, assuming that the government will adjust the domestic regulated price  responsively according to the international price.Should the regulated gas price be revised downward, this would be good news for local manufacturers, including glove makers, who have been complaining of high gas and electricity prices following a hike in the gas price by Gas Malaysia Bhd and the imbalance cost pass-through (ICPT) surcharge by the Energy Commission.Last December, Gas Malaysia increased the average natural gas base tariff to non-power users in Peninsular Malaysia to RM32.69 per mmBtu, from RM31.92. Together with the 23 sen per mmBtu gas cost pass-through surcharge, this works out to RM32.92 per mmBtu.The new gas tariff applies to January to June this year.“Incentive-based regulation parameters set the market’s natural price at RM35 per mmBtu. If the (international) market price of LNG is lower than this, then the cost savings will be passed on to consumers,” says Hafriz Hezry, an analyst with MIDF Research who covers Tenaga Nasional Bhd.Furthermore, the drop in coal and LNG prices also prompted many to wonder whether that would bring down eletricity tariff.The ICPT was implemented  to enable the fluctuation of fuel costs to be passed down to end-users through adjustments of electricty tariffs every six months.Coal accounts for half the fuel mix for power production, piped gas being the second biggest.Hafriz noted that lower coal prices will reduce the system’s overall generation cost, and any cost savings will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower electricity rates.However, Hafriz notes that the price of the piped gas supply to the power sector is regulated. And that price has been raised by RM1.50 per mmBtu every six months in  order to be on a par with the international price. The piped gas supply volume is also capped at one billion scf per day.“Any excess consumption of natural gas will then be sourced at the market price.  Given that the generation mix is currently skewed heavily towards coal, the power sector hardly hits the one billion scf per day ceiling,” he says via email.The current regulated gas price to the power sector is RM27.20 per mmBtu. This will rise to RM28.70 in the second half, says Hafriz.Meanwhile, his colleague Noor Athila Mohd Razali, who covers the oil and gas industry, believes natural gas prices will recover over the next few months as the equilibrium between demand and supply improves. She says LNG prices tend to be restored within a short period of time if the gyrations were due to the imbalance of supply and demand.Commenting on the EIA’s projection of US exports of natural gas reaching nine billion scf per day this year, Athila says the increase in supply is expected to be absorbed by Europe and Asia — to be led by China.“China saw a 78% improvement in winter air since it began to rigorously switch from coal to the cleaner natural gas due to its desire to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement. There is a growing and increasing need for China to fuel its economy using cleaner energy and this is expected to drive the demand for LNG.“China is now the second largest LNG importer after Japan with imports doubling over the past two years. China’s demand is mainly driven by its industrial sector and residential and commercial use, and we opine that this will continue to be the case going forward,” she says. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/will-lower-lng-prices-bring-down-local-energy-costs

(April 5, RM12.62)
Maintain buy with a target price (TP) of RM15.50: Concerns over the impact of industry reforms appear overly pessimistic and possibly misplaced in our view. We believe these concerns would be alleviated as clarity emerges in the coming months. With that, we expect a rerating of the share price to levels that better reflect Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s (TNB) earnings stability.A commonly mooted reform is the possible introduction of retail competition, which would allow third parties into the “customer services” segment. The net operating profit after tax attributable to this segment is merely about RM20 million annually. This does not entail the farming-out of TNB’s existing distribution assets to third parties (such a move would require shareholders’ approval in any case). On a stand-alone basis, the introduction of retail competition is unlikely to move the needle much with regard to tariff savings in our view.Another frequently mentioned reform is the possible migration towards a full “merchant market” in the generation space (where generators bid to produce electricity), thus theoretically driving down tariffs and lowering generation returns. Technicalities aside, current-generation returns (inbuilt into capacity payments) are effectively guaranteed upon fulfilment of availability (not generation) targets under the existing power purchase agreement (PPA) framework. A premature dismantling of the PPA framework would require hefty compensation by the government.Our earnings forecasts and TP of RM15.50 are unchanged. Our TP is derived from a discounted cash flow, assuming 7.5% weighted average cost of capital and 1% long-term growth, implying a financial year 2019 price-earnings ratio of 15.9 times. — Maybank IB Research, April 5",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/rerating-earnings-stability-expected-tnb

"April 04, 2019 16:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Another quiet quarter for high-rise residences","Cautious market sentiments are expected to prevail in the near term as the residential high-rise secondary market remained inactive in the last quarter of 2018. The inactivity was due to a lack of improvement in the market following the general election in May last year and the measures announced in Budget 2019, which consisted of a mixed bag of property-related news, says Amy Wong, Savills Malaysia director of research and consultancy, when presenting The Edge/Savills Klang Valley high-rise residential property monitor for 4Q2018.“According to the samples of our research analysis, the transaction volume of high-rise residences in the secondary market dropped in both KL and Selangor in 2018 compared with 2017. KL recorded only half of the total transaction volume compared to the previous year,” she explains.The KL secondary market for high-rises remained quiet in the review period. KLCC and Bangsar recorded no transactions for 2-bedroom units whereas a very limited number of similar properties were transacted in Mont’Kiara.The transaction value was flat in KLCC, Bangsar and Mont’Kiara in 4Q2018. In general, the prices ranged from RM830 to RM1,810 psf in KLCC, from RM750 to RM1,200 psf in Bangsar and from RM610 to RM700 psf in Mont’Kiara.“Further checks revealed that the average asking price in these three zones dropped about 3% quarter on quarter in 4Q2018, although it was still 10% to 15% higher than the average transacted value.“Having said that, the high-rise residential property market in KL is expected to remain challenging due to the large impending supply in the near term,” says Wong.Selangor’s secondary market for high-rise residences was also quiet in the review period with fewer transactions. Both the transaction value and asking price were lower compared with 2017.“We expect high-rise property prices in the Selangor secondary market to be subdued in some locations due to stiff competition from the primary market where developers are offering buyers attractive homeownership packages,” says Wong. Another slow quarter in KLKLCC recorded a lower volume of secondary high-rise residential transactions year on year. Transactions had surged more than 20% in 2017 before halving last year, says Savills Malaysia.Fewer secondary transactions were recorded in KLCC after GE14. According to Wong, this sluggish trend applied to residential units of all sizes, including the sampled 2-bedroom, 1,000 to 1,600 sq ft apartments. “Although the more recent launches, including small offices/home offices (SoHos), focused on smaller units of between 500 and 1,000 sq ft, the secondary market in KLCC is still inclined towards the bigger units of more than 1,500 sq ft. These accounted for over half the secondary market transactions last year.”Some new launches in the primary market in 2016 and 2017 reportedly saw decent take-ups. Stonor 3, 10 Stonor, Eaton Residences and SO Sofitel Kuala Lumpur Residences, for instance, were 50% sold as at 4Q2018. Most of these launches offered 1 to 2-bedroom units of 1,000 sq ft and below, and priced at more than RM1,200 psf.Only RuMa Hotel & Residences was completed in KLCC in 4Q2018, adding 200 units to the market. There were no new launches during this period.“The prospects for high-rise residential properties in KLCC remain challenging. With over 6,000 units of new supply scheduled for completion in KLCC by 2020, there is unlikely to be an upswing in market activity and pricing in the near term,” says Wong.In Bangsar, the overall secondary market saw slower activity year on year with fewer transactions in the second half of last year, particularly in 4Q2018. “Units of between 1,000 and 1,499 sq ft remained popular in the area, accounting for 30% of secondary market transactions last year. As for capital value, high-rise residential properties remained stable year on year,” says Wong.Cascadium recorded its highest transacted price per square foot of RM1,250 in 3Q2018. Asking prices for units of similar size in the development were lower at between RM792 and RM1,185 psf.“According to our conversation with property agents, poorly maintained properties in Bangsar are likely to experience lower asking prices/possible value depreciation,” says Wong.As at 4Q2018, four low-density residential projects were under construction in Bangsar, offering between 18 and 56 units per scheme, and are slated for completion by 2019 to 2020. This year, work is expected to commence on two projects in Bangsar, one of which is the unnamed mixed-use development on the site of the Tenaga Nasional Bhd headquarters and the other a low-density residential development by Xian Property.Unlike in KLCC and Bangsar, Mont’Kiara’s secondary market saw more activity last year despite experiencing lower transaction volume. Savills Malaysia’s analysis reveals that the more than 60% secondary transactions last year consisted of high-rises of 1,500 sq ft and above in size.Fewer 2-bedroom high-rise residential properties were transacted in Mont’Kiara in 4Q2018 while the average price of the samples retracted about 3% quarter on quarter to RM736 psf.Most of the under-construction projects in Mont’Kiara are reportedly 60% to 70% sold. Residensi Astrea Mont’Kiara, for example, had recorded a take-up of 60% as at 4Q2018 since its launch last October.Last year, the launch price of high-rise residential properties hovered between RM620,000 and RM1.2 million or RM630 and RM1,100 psf. Among the incentives offered by developers to attract purchasers were cash rebates, low down payment, and guaranteed rental return.“We don’t expect an upswing in the prices of properties in Mont’Kiara for the near term as the overall market sentiments, especially on the secondary market, are still weak. Also, there will be a bulk of new supply coming into the market between 2019 and 2020,” says Wong. Lower transactions in SelangorThe secondary market in Bandar Sunway was inactive in 4Q2018, prolonging from 1H2018. In the review period, the asking price of 3-bedroom high-rise residences registered a drop of 2% quarter on quarter, hovering at around RM500 to RM800 psf.Recently launched high-rise developments comprised mainly smaller units (including SoHos) with some being dual-key units targeted at the young demographic.

"April 01, 2019 16:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Cover Story: Building a sense of neighbourliness","A chance meeting could change one’s life. For Temokin Holdings Sdn Bhd group executive director Datuk Robert Tan Kim Kuan, the serendipitous event occurred when he first arrived at Universiti Malaya in the early 1970s.“In those days, there was no professional career guidance. I only knew the professions of teaching, medicine and law enforcement,” Robert recalls with a smile. “Being a doctor or policeman was out, so I signed up at the science faculty in Universiti Malaya [to be a teacher]. After that, a friend of mine looked at my results and said why don’t I try engineering?“I asked him what an engineer did and he explained it to me. He said engineers construct houses for people to stay in and build roads to get people from one point to another; which I considered noble work. So, instead of going to the science faculty, I went to the engineering faculty. I changed my major and it was God’s guidance.”Robert graduated in 1974 with a degree in civil engineering and started his career in the government sector. After 2½ years, he moved to a consultancy and stayed a further 2½ years before joining YTL Construction, where he rose through the ranks to become chief engineer.In 1990, with a young family, he decided to strike out on his own and founded Temokin Holdings Sdn Bhd. “After 14 years of working for people, I felt I was ready to start my own company. First, I wanted to challenge myself to see how much I could do and, second, I needed more money to feed my family,” he says with a chuckle. “I set up Temokin Holdings with a capital of RM35,000. We then got three Tenaga Nasional substation projects. We did earthworks for Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Selangor (PKNS), a highway in Klang for Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia and a sewage project for PKNS.”The company continued to do well in the 1990s and survived the Asian financial crisis. “In 1997, when the crisis came, I bought a RM2 million microtunnelling machine from Japan. I got two projects, which was more than enough to cover my cost,” says Robert. The mix of private and government projects involved companies such as Dialog Group Bhd, Puncak Niaga Holdings Bhd and Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur. Microtunnelling, also called pipe jacking, uses smaller drills to build underground pipelines, ducts and culverts.Two of his four children — three boys and a girl — became engineers. One of them is his youngest son, Chien Chyi, who is the director of the company’s property development division, Temokin Development Sdn Bhd. “I took up engineering because I had grown up going to work sites and construction sites. I think that exposure showcased that engineering is a good foundation,” he says. “I didn’t think I could do pure engineering, so I moved into property development, which is a natural progression from engineering.”Robert agrees with his son and believes that the communal element of construction marries well with property development. “Construction is very communal. We construct roads for people to go from one point to another, we construct bridges for people to cross rivers, flyovers to ease traffic congestion and channels to supply water to households. We help deal with sewage before it goes into the rivers,” he explains.The move into property development was always a goal for Robert but he held back until 2011, when he incorporated Temokin Development. “When I was in the construction industry, I already had plans to go into property development. I started by buying pieces of land first.”He bided his time until his children had graduated and he encouraged them to work in the family company. “For a company to continue, you must inject new and young blood to make it vibrant. I decided to start the property development division but we took two to three years to learn about the industry before launching our first project.”Products that create a communityTemokin Development wants to come up with products that help create a community feeling through greater engagement. Placemaking — the approach of planning, designing and managing public spaces for the wellbeing of stakeholders — is an integral part of this vision.“We always operate from our group values of ‘WE DIG’, where W is wisdom, E is equality, D is diligence, I is integrity and G is guidance. So with all this, it sparks a communal aspect in our DNA. We want to be a community-based property developer,” says Chien Chyi.Temokin Development’s maiden project — the freehold Mahligai in Nusa Damai, Pasir Gudang, Johor — sits on 11.5 acres and has a gross development value (GDV) of RM100 million. The land was purchased in 2014 for RM10 million or RM35.80 psf.“The surrounding areas are developed and mature. Somehow, the owner of the land, a developer, decided to sell it,” explains Robert.“We named our maiden project Mahligai because the word is Sanskrit for ‘mansion’ and we believe that anyone who buys our product will be able to come home to and enjoy their own mansion,” says Chien Chyi.Robert adds, “Mahligai is also a Malay word. I asked my Malay business partner, who said, to him, it means ‘heaven’. And in heaven, you get peace. So I said ‘Okay, we will go with this name [for our first project].”The development is divided into three phases, says Chien Chyi. “We are launching the development in phases so that we can develop something better [in each phase], to give our buyers a better product. From Phase 1, we collected feedback from buyers, and we have incorporated them into the design of Phase 2.“The target market is Johoreans, a localised market, and first-time homebuyers. The product is uniquely priced and very strategically located. We’re happy to say that 80% of Phase 1, which we launched last year, has been taken up and most of the buyers were within our target market,” he says.Launched last Sept 25, Phase 1 consists of 53 two-storey terraced houses. The 20ft by 70ft homes with built-ups of 1,679 to 1,752 sq ft were priced from RM562,000, or RM368 psf on average. The targeted handover is April 2020.Phase 2, scheduled to be launched next month, features 87 two-storey terraced houses. The 20ft by 70ft homes with built-ups of 1,759 to 1,802 sq ft will have indicative prices starting from RM593,000, or RM393 psf on average.“For security, we have incorporated a guardhouse and are seeking approval from the local council to fence up certain areas to prevent outsiders from entering,” says Chien Chyi.Mahligai will boast of three parks — two larger parks and a pocket park — for residents to enjoy. To create a sense of ownership of these green spaces, Temokin Development has embarked on a placemaking initiative called Kita Bersama. One of its first engagement activities is to gather views from future residents of Mahligai — buyers of Phase 1 as well as prospective buyers — of what they would like to see incorporated in the larger parks, after which a vote will be taken.The pocket park will be landscaped by the developer as it is a small plot. “This is not a strata development but one with individual titles. So we wanted to give the buyers and the local council easy-to-maintain but effective landscaping and practical green space,” says Chien Chyi.After the 11.5 acres are fully developed, the common spaces will be handed over to the local authorities to maintain.No launch date has been set for the last phase but Chien Chyi reveals that the homes will be larger at three storeys and have direct access to the green spaces.The development is accessible via the Pasir Gudang Highway and Senai-Desaru Expressway. Education centres in the vicinity include Sultan Ibrahim Premier Polytechnic Johor Bahru, Universiti Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Institute of Industrial Technology, UniWorld International School and The Japanese School of Johor. Mydin, Tesco and Maslee Pasir Gudang Supermarket among others will cater for residents’ grocery and other household needs. KPJ Pasir Gudang Specialist Hospital, Penawar Hospital and Regency Specialist Hospital are also nearby.Developing a presence in the Klang ValleyThe Tans will incorporate their placemaking initiatives in future developments. While it is a good idea, will it be possible to replicate it in other places as it requires plenty of engagement and planning?The Tans are up to the challenge. “Doing something like this [placemaking] isn’t easy. Building highways, tall buildings and so on is not easy. From a construction point of view, nothing is easy,” Chien Chyi says. “So, mirroring that in development, there are so many factors that are not easy. But we want to strive and engage in [placemaking] because we are a people-centric community developer. In whatever development we do, we want to embrace that factor.”Currently, the developer has a land bank of 50 acres, which is spread over the central region of Peninsular Malaysia.“We are launching a project this year in Taman Melati, Gombak — a freehold development on 2.2 acres. We are looking to build 24 landed superlink homes. Built on Malay Reserve land, the houses will be 24ft by 123ft with a built-up of 3,000 sq ft,” says Chien Chyi.“The key aspect is that 12 units will have a dual-key concept. This is because of the maturity of the area and the project’s location near the Gombak LRT station. We’ve found that there is potential capital appreciation for homeowners who want to rent out their second space or keep it for a family member.”The selling price is yet to be set but the estimated GDV is RM40 million. The Tans plan to launch the project in 2H2019.Also in the pipeline is a joint-venture project with Tropicana Corp Bhd on a 2.28-acre freehold parcel located near 3 Damansara in Petaling Jaya. The JV, which will most likely feature a high-rise block, was signed on Sept 27 last year.For now, Temokin Development’s focus will be on the central and southern regions of Peninsular Malaysia and it will bide its time to develop its remaining land bank to ensure that it meets the needs of the market.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-building-sense-neighbourliness

"March 28, 2019 11:30 am +08",TENAGA,"Apps: Providing investors with comprehensive financial information","When it comes to online investing tools, investors are spoilt for choice. However, many of these tools are not user-friendly and can be difficult to manoeuvre. Clunky interface, limited information and a lack of proper explanations are just some of the complaints of users.To solve these problems, 8Bit Global Pte Ltd (a joint venture between 8VIC Global and 8I Holdings) has developed WealthPark, a smart investing technology platform that provides information on companies listed on stock exchanges around the world.Gary Yeow, director of 8VIC Malaysia Sdn Bhd, says WealthPark was designed to provide investors with a faster, smarter and easier-to-use investment tool. “We know a lot of investors do not have the time [to assess companies]. But they want simple digestible information at their fingertips. WealthPark does most of the work for them. Investors only need five minutes to read up on a company before making a buy or sell decision.”WealthPark gives users access to comprehensive data on companies across 11 categories. They can view up to 10 years’ worth of information, including the companies’ income, balance sheet and cash flow statements and growth performance. The information is accompanied with visuals such as charts and tables for a better overview (see Image 1).WealthPark provides investors with information on companies listed on 24 stock exchanges around the world, including the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, Australian Securities Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, Stock Exchange of Thailand and Bursa Malaysia.The platform’s raw data is acquired from Capital IQ, the research division of Standard and Poor’s. Then, it is turned into a simple dashboard interface by WealthPark. While the data is not provided in real time (up to 12 hours delay), Yeow says this should not be a problem to its target users as the tool is intended for long-term value investors who are not looking to make a quick profit.He adds that the amount of data available can be overwhelming, especially to beginner investors. That is why almost every single label on WealthPark can be clicked on for further explanation. Some even come with video tutorials that investors can refer to.Subscribers have access to the WealthPark Learn Facebook page, which provides user support and additional learning materials. The company also holds classes every fortnight for investors who wish to learn more about how they can leverage the tool to make better investment decisions.WealthPark has a lot of features that allow investors to make quick assessments. One of them is WP Rating, a probabilistic framework developed by WealthPark and Singapore-based research firm Hidden Champions Capital Management (see Image 2).The rating examines 13 areas of investment risk due to potential aggressive accounting undertaken by the companies, which are rated either one, two or three stars to denote the level of investment risk. Investors may want to keep this in mind when making their investment decisions, says Yeow.“The WP Rating is one of the features we provide that the other tools in the market do not. The areas we examine include shareholder dilution, where a company can decrease existing shareholders’ ownership of a company with the issuance of new equity. Another area we examine is window dressing, where a company understates its expenses and overstates its profit to present a better-looking financial report,” he adds.Hong Kong-based China Resources Cement Holdings Ltd, for example, is given three stars. All 13 areas of investment risk are given green labels, which indicate that the level of risk is low.A feature that will help investors quickly understand the key aspects of a company is Star Chart, which summarises 107 data points of a company to give investors a visual snapshot of its strengths and weaknesses. The summarised data covers the company’s profitability, financial health, assets held, growth and dividends paid out (see Image 3).To make the data more interesting, the companies are given animal classifications. According to Yeow, there are six animals. For example, the gorilla represents companies that have continually achieved stable and high revenue and/or earnings growth due to their unique and strong competitive advantage.These companies also have the ability to reinvest and compound their earnings at high rates of return, which are suitable for investors who want to explore or invest in companies for capital gains. “Similar to gorilla, cheetah companies have achieved high revenue and/or earnings growth, but may not necessarily be stable,” says Yeow.The other four animals are cow (companies that may pay out consistent and sustainable dividends), elephant (companies that are asset-heavy), sloth (companies with slower revenue or earnings growth than the industry average). Meanwhile the non-animal classification “UFO” refer to companies that cannot be classified.Most value investors calculate a company’s intrinsic value using fundamental analysis to determine whether it is currently under or overvalued. To save investors time, WealthPark does the calculations and visualises them on a line chart.The platform has a healthy pipeline of things it wants to introduce in the future, says Yeow. One that is currently being tested is the portfolio feature, which will allow investors to manually add into these portfolios companies that they are invested in to track the profit and loss of their previous investments. The feature will also be able to calculate investors’ currency gain or loss.“This is a handy feature for those who tend to forget their investments, especially those they made more than three years ago,” says Yeow.WealthPark is also testing the peers feature, which is currently at the beta stage. This feature lets investors compare a company with other similar ones listed on other stock exchanges. This is especially important when assessing companies with a monopoly in the industry, such as Tenaga Nasional Bhd, says Yeow. The companies can be compared by either their gross profit margins, WP Ratings or returns on equity, among others.According to WealthPark, Tenaga’s top peers are Osaka Gas Co Ltd (listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange), NRG Energy Inc and The AES Corp (both listed on the New York Stock Exchange).The platform will introduce more stock exchanges in the near future. WealthPark’s current users are 8VIC graduates and attendees of events organised by the company. The tool will be officially launched to the public in May.WealthPark is available in seven languages, including Bahasa Malaysia, Japanese and Thai. There are three pricing structures. Investors who choose to subscribe to only one stock exchange will be charged US$120 a year. Subscribing to seven exchanges will cost them US$365 a year while subscribing to all exchanges will set investors back US$1,299 a year.The mobile app is available on Google Play and the App Store. Users can also access the platform on their desktops.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/apps-providing-investors-comprehensive-financial-information

With a reduction in energy cost, the cost to manufacture and deliver goods also drops, leading to reduced cost to consumers,” it said.FMM is hopeful that the measures to be put in place to facilitate investment in energy efficiency initiatives by industry players, especially the small and medium enterprises, could mitigate the volatility in energy prices.“FMM looks forward to continued engagement with the Government in order to sustain the competitiveness of businesses in view of the external uncertainties and concurrent cost increases that are already imposed on businesses,” it said.Earlier today, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) had called on Gas Malaysia Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) to revise the natural gas tariff, as it is expecting a substantial drop in natural gas price due to the sharp fall in prices of liquefied natural gas and coal in recent months.The association pointed to the Asian LNG pricing, using Japan Korea futures, which has fallen by 60% to US$4.62 per MMBtu from its peak at US$11.81 per MMBtu in September last year.The price of coal has also dropped by almost 25% to US$88.25 per tonne from US$118 per tonne as of July 2018.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fmm-concerned-over-icpt-surcharge-hopes-lower-electricity-tariff
"March 26, 2019 16:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"BIMB still expected to beat its peers","IN recent years, BIMB Holdings Bhd has consistently outperformed the banking industry on important fronts like return on equity (ROE) and financing growth. But with the operating environment getting increasingly tough, a key question on investors’ minds is, will it be able to sustain the strong growth levels?CEO Mohd Muazzam Mohamed acknowledges that it will be challenging but he is confident the group will keep growing over the next three years, albeit at a more moderate pace.“We used to do double-digit growth in net financing in the past years but since 2017, we slowed to single-digit growth. Last year, we did 8.5% [versus the industry’s 4.5%]. This year, it will moderate further, probably to around 7%, but it would still be above the industry average, I would say. Growth in profit before zakat and tax (PBZT) may be a bit slower too, but there will still be growth,” he tells The Edge in an interview.A financial holding company, BIMB derives about 80% of its earnings from its wholly-owned Islamic lender Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd and the rest from its 59.6%-owned Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga Bhd.Two weeks ago, BIMB turned in a record net profit of RM682 million for FY2018, a 10.1% increase year on year, helped by solid financing growth, cost containment and stable margins.Its earnings fell within analysts’ expectations and translated into an ROE of 14.3%, higher than the industry average of around 10%. PBZT grew 12.5% to RM1.07 billion while revenue grew 12.9% to RM4.2 billion.BIMB’s earnings were commendable considering that the group had made an allowance for impairment of financial assets of RM81.4 million — owing mainly to the kicking in of the new MFRS 9 accounting standard — compared with a write-back of RM15.4 million in the previous year. Three-year planAccording to Muazzam, BIMB’s growth over the next three years will be fuelled mainly by consumer financing. However, an increased focus on fee-based income and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) will give the group a boost, he says.BIMB plans to grow fee-based income by driving its bancatakaful and wealth management businesses further. This will be done by increasing product offerings as well as improving staff productivity, he says.“As for wealth management, we’re doing two things. We’re doubling our sales executives to about 200 this year. We’re not hiring new people but converting over 100 of our existing 520 personal financial executives — the people who sell cards, personal and house financing — into wealth executives. Of course, they’ll need to take the necessary exams, obtain licences and all that first. The other thing we’re doing is increasing our products,” he shares.Its fund management firm BIMB Investment Management Bhd has a partnership with UK-based Arabesque Asset Management that it hopes to tap further. Arabesque is an environmental, social and governance (ESG)-Quant specialist that uses robo technology and data analytics when investing.Muazzam says BIMB is open to the possibility of selling up to 40% equity interest in BIMB Investment to Arabesque as it sees value in what its foreign partner brings to the table. It is understood that Arabesque has an option to take an equity stake in BIMB Investment but has yet to exercise it.BIMB’s fee-based income as a percentage of gross revenue stood at below-9% last year on the consumer side, and the target is to increase it to 10% this year and 12% by end-2021.As for SMEs, Muazzam says BIMB’s financing to this segment stood at RM2.2 billion as at-end 2018. He wants to grow this by about 10% this year. “We have so far been focused on the bigger SMEs and not so much on the smaller entrepreneurs. Going foward, we will continue to focus on our vendor programmes with big companies like Petronas, Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia, where we finance [SMEs] that have contracts with them. But, at the same time, we are developing capabilities [that will help us finance] SMEs in the lower-revenue ranks,” he says.For example, he says BIMB is working with a group of professors to come up with a psychometric model.“In the past, a bank’s credit evaluation model was about assessing the customers’ ability to pay. Even though we say we have a behavioural card, what we look at is past payment behaviours. But now, we want to develop a tool for us to be able to assess the customer’s willingness to pay ... because as we go down the [SME] tier, these customers would have less of or little historical credit track record. That’s why banks find it difficult to give them financing. But, as you know, there’ll be a lot more of such companies in the future, so we must develop new tools to assess them,” he says.This is, however, still at the developmental phase. “Hopefully, by 2021, we will be able to launch it so we can go into [financing] online retailers and all that,” he says. CODE21Home and personal financing will remain BIMB’s main growth drivers. Last year, these accounted for 53.4% and 39.4% respectively of its consumer financing portfolio.Muazzam is not overly concerned about the weaker property market affecting the group’s asset quality. “The good thing is that we focus on properties that are priced at RM750,000 and below. Supply and demand is still there, so we are comfortable about building in that segment. On the corporate side, our exposure to real estate is not that big and we are very selective ... the [vulnerable] areas like hotels and big retail malls, we try not to get involved,” he explains.Its exposure to real estate stands at just 3.68% of total financing, while for construction, it is 5.2%.Meanwhile, BIMB’s exposure to the oil and gas sector — an area that analysts continue to monitor closely given weak oil prices — has come down to 8.4% as at end-2018 from 9% a year earlier.“To be honest, for us, there is no specific sector that has been showing a worrying trend,” Muazzam remarks. He points out that BIMB’s asset quality remains strong, with gross impaired financing ratio at just 0.92% as at end-2018, better than the industry’s 1.45%.Muazzam shares that Bank Islam has embarked on a three-year transformation programme, CODE21, so named because it aspires towards culture, operational and digital excellence by end-2021. It involves the improvement of its processes and controls and retraining of staff.The programme is ultimately aimed at making BIMB the country’s leading digital Islamic bank of choice by 2021. BIMB aspires to achieve PBZT of RM1 billion by end-2021, from RM810.3 million last year, says Muazzam.Additionally, it wants to be the leading bank for social finance. Initiatives on this end will be through Sadaqa House, Bank Islam’s donation platform that enables funds to be channelled to needy communities through the bank’s partners.Over the 2019-2021 period, Bank Islam is expected to spend RM300 million on digital initiatives and technology, starting with RM150 million this year.Nevertheless, Muazzam expects BIMB’s cost-to-income ratio (CIR) to lower further to 51% this year from 57.5% last year and 61.4% in 2017.The group’s CIR had been on the high side over the years as it added branches in a bid to reach an optimal level. It currently has 148 branches and has no plans to add more.Muazzam is fairly confident the bank will be able to maintain its net income margin (NIM) at around 2.65% this year as there is less pressure to chase costly deposits. Last year, it scrambled to increase long-term deposits in a bid to raise its net stable funding ratio to over 100%. It raised its base rate by 13 basis points last November.As for Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Keluarga, the public-listed company has had good growth in recent years, with PBZT growing at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14.4% over the last five years compared with 3.7% for Bank Islam. “Its PBZT will continue to grow this year, albeit probably not as strongly as last year’s 32.7%,” says Muazzam. Restructuring soonBIMB’s three-year plan does not involve a merger with another bank, says Muazzam. “We don’t rule it out, but at this point in time, there isn’t any proposal on the table. I would say, if we’ve got to merge, it must be with a [partner] that will further strengthen us and not cause the bank to carry extra weight going forward,” he remarks.In the meantime, though, all eyes are on BIMB’s anticipated restructuring exercise, which will involve Bank Islam taking over its listed status. The move is aimed at collapsing BIMB’s financial holding structure.According to Muazzam, there is likely to be an announcement on this in the second quarter. He declines to divulge more details, saying only that the group first has to address a shareholder debt. The Edge reported in late January that BIMB, controlled by Lembaga Tabung Haji, was seriously considering undertaking a private placement of new shares to raise funds to repay a shareholder debt of some RM800 million ahead of the restructuring.“More visibility on BIMB’s much-talked-about restructuring plans could fuel investor interest in the stock, though we think consistent delivery of robust earnings growth would also keep the stock on a positive trajectory,” says AllianceDBS Research in a March 4 report.Bloomberg data shows that eight out of nine analysts who track the stock have a “buy” call on it, with one calling a “hold”. The median target price was RM5.02.According to RHB Research, the stock still has attractive upside, notwithstanding its 19.1% year-to-date increase. “Underlying operations continue to outpace its peers while its balance sheet is healthy. As investors get greater clarity on its reorganisation plans, its price-to-book multiple will rise to levels more reflective of its resilient profitability and position as a proxy to the largest standalone Islamic bank in Malaysia,” it says.   ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/bimb-still-expected-beat-its-peers

"March 26, 2019 11:30 am +08",TENAGA,"My Say: Policy certainty and investor confidence","There was a stir in the news flow when Khazanah Nasional Bhd’s financial results were released earlier this month. The fund posted its first loss in 15 years — a RM6.27 billion loss before tax in 2018 compared to a RM2.9 billion profit before tax in 2017. The losses were from impairments of some of its investments — a whopping RM7.3 billion. The more appropriate measure of its performance, however, and the more telling one, is the 21.6% drop in the net worth adjusted (NWA) of the portfolio from RM116 billion in 2017 to RM91 billion in 2018.A more detailed look shows that the value of Khazanah’s holdings in its two telcos alone, Axiata Group Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), lost RM8.5 billion in market capitalisation, while the drop in the share prices of Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (CIMB) and IHH Healthcare Bhd (IHH) contributed to the contraction of the NWA. Clearly, market sentiment towards these major Khazanah investee companies turned negative, resulting in the drop of their share prices. The share price of TM opened 2018 at above RM6 and closed the year at RM2.65, hitting a low of RM2.15 along the way. The FBM KLCI, by contrast, contracted only 3% in 2018.The explanation for the contraction of the NWA is a rather straightforward one. While overall market sentiments softened in 2018, the FBM KLCI still outperformed both the MSCI Global and Emerging Market indices. The 21.6% drop in Khazanah’s NWA is, therefore, peculiar to its holdings in selected companies — TM, Axiata, TNB, CIMB, IHH and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB). There were policy and regulatory changes in 2018 that affected these particular companies and, therefore, market sentiments towards them. Herein lies a larger issue.These same companies, all of them public companies, have other investors, institutional and retail, domestic and foreign. These investors too suffered the same losses as Khazanah. Major domestic institutional investors such as the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) and Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KWAP) must have invested in these historically well-performing companies and they, too, will have suffered similar losses in value, which will affect both their portfolio values as well as the dividends they pay out to their respective subscribers.Beyond these domestic institutional investors, there are also foreign funds that invest in good performing Malaysian companies. They, too, will have invested in these same companies and they would have suffered the same losses. While some domestic institutional investors are constrained from investing in domestic markets, foreign investors are free to move to where the risk-weighted returns are the best. Some of them have exited our market, with net foreign fund outflow for 2018 totalling RM11.6 billion.What has happened is that policy and regulatory changes adversely affected market sentiments — not just for the specific companies but, more alarmingly, for the Malaysian market more generally. These sporadic bouts of policy changes would have been tolerated by investors if they were part of a broader policy shift that is well communicated and understood, but that is not the case.In the case of the telcos, policy and regulatory changes — on what should have been commercial decisions such as product design and pricing — seriously affected earnings forecasts and, therefore, investors’ valuations of the companies. The drop in share prices simply reflect that outlook. This is the kind of regulatory risks that investors are fearful of. They are capable of assessing companies’ operational efficiency as well as locating them properly within the industry landscape but it is regulatory risks that present a challenge and thus constitutes the larger bulk of risk.Changes in regulatory regimes that are seen as reacting to specific impetus without a broader coherence will just increase the risk profile of Malaysia as a whole. The Malaysian economy can ill-afford the increased risk profile. Our current account surplus has dwindled over the years, closing 2018 at barely 3% of gross domestic product, and it is not expected to improve given sluggish trade sentiments, while the need to borrow and refinance debts will continue. Portfolio outflows make things worse. Therefore, maintaining investors’ confidence and managing the country’s risk profile is of utmost importance.What is still missing at the policy level today is a big picture economic story — phrased positively in terms of what it is rather than what it is not. That will set a direction, a focal point for all other subsidiary stories. It will also identify the lynchpins of the story — the key economic imperatives that drive the whole story, among which, I reckon, is to protect investors’ confidence.Matters of policy relate to the boundary between the state and markets. What is the role of the government in the economy? From the perspective of the capital market, terms like government-linked companies (GLCs) should be properly used or its usage abandoned altogether. Policy and regulations cannot discriminate between GLCs and non-GLCs if a company, a public company, is deemed a GLC merely because statutory funds whose monies do not belong to the government, such as the EPF, PNB and Social Security Organisation (Socso) have shares in it. Are Sime Darby, Malayan Banking Bhd, CIMB, Axiata and IJM Corp Bhd government-related companies?In the case of sectors where there used to be natural monopolies, such as utilities and airports, privatised public enterprises such as TNB, TM and Malaysia Airports may still have government holdings in the form of Khazanah shares in them, but these are publicly listed companies with sizeable private and even international investors, and they should neither be favoured nor made victims of policy or regulations.These are commercial entities and should be treated as such — treated by how they behave in the marketplace rather than according to their lineage or even the composition of their shareholders. Commercial disputes between companies, for example, should be matters resolved by the rule of law without the parentage of companies being taken into consideration, what more direct government intervention.The whole point of the Putrajaya Committee for GLC High Performance programme launched in 2004 was to improve the performance of the 20 publicly listed companies that had either significant holdings by statutory funds or a governmental legacy so that they are subjected to market discipline and their governance be made equally transparent.When the 10-year programme ended in 2015, the total shareholder return of these 20 companies grew at 11.1% annually and their aggregate market capitalisation increased from RM133.8 billion to RM386 billion — almost a three times multiple.Beyond that, the regulatory environment was improved mainly by clearly demarcating policy, which can get enmeshed with the political imperative of the government and regulation, which should be driven by promoting healthy competition to attract investors into industries. Empowering shareholders and the presence of regulators, independent of policymakers, create a rules-based environment, the kind of environment investors prefer.The problematic part of government’s presence in the economy are the numerous companies established by the various statutory bodies. There has been a proliferation of these companies. These are not government-linked companies, but outright government-owned, effectively state-owned enterprises (SOEs). They should be properly labelled and need some sort of rationalisation, and a major part of public sector reform should be a serious re-examination of the government’s use of non-governmental organisations — companies established under the Companies Act — as policy tools.The government has been using companies as policy tools in the form of SOEs to achieve bumiputera participation objectives but this approach has not worked. Compare this to the much better performance of funds such as PNB using the capital markets to invest and therefore support performing firms, but the firms they invest in should be treated neutrally by the regulations.These are not GLCs, certainly not SOEs, but public companies with a wide spectrum of investors whose collective performance defines the health of the country’s economy. Truth be told, PNB operating in the capital market has been more successful in achieving the bumiputera agenda objectives than most other policy tools.Clarity in these fundamental issues will create the right environment and the right incentives for investors to decide which enterprises to support and what, in their view, are potentially profitable ones. The government should have a facilitative and not a participative role. It should focus on providing policy clarity and regulatory certainty to attract investments. In order to obtain such an outcome, the government must first articulate a big picture story that sets a strategic direction understood by all interested parties.Nungsari A Radhi is an economist.

"March 25, 2019 14:00 pm +08",TENAGA," Lead Story: Opportunities in oil & gas, construction","THE FBM KLCI may be the only major Asian stock market index to have slipped into the red, year to date, but investors who pivoted to small caps at the end of last year could be in a buoyant mood.This is because the FBM Small Cap Index’s total return of nearly 15% outperformed that of most major stock market indices. With a yield of 20%, only China’s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index provided better returns.Although the FBM KLCI recorded a slight 0.7% decline, Bursa Malaysia as a whole saw an 11.8% gain year to date, adding RM50.4 billion to its market capitalisation.This marks a strong recovery from the selldown in the second half of last year, which was led by foreign selling in the aftermath of a historic and unprecedented change in government after the 14th general election.A total of RM119.3 billion was wiped out of Bursa after GE14 in May until the end of last year.UOB Asset Management (M) Bhd chief investment officer Francis Eng sees the robust start in the small-cap space this year as a recovery from the selldown last year.He says there is value in selected small-cap companies following the decline last year and lists the preferred sectors as technology and manufacturing, particularly semiconductor equipment makers and consumer-related companies. “We also see pockets of opportunity in the beaten-down and unloved sectors, such as oil and gas and construction,” Eng tells The Edge.He attributes the performance of the small caps to the low base effect. “Amid the headwinds faced by emerging markets, including Asia, last year, the FBM KLCI was one of the better performing indices with a decline of 5.9%.“In comparison, the decline in the FBM Small Cap Index was much sharper at 33.7%. Even with the gain year to date, the FBM Small Cap Index is still down 23.9% compared with the start of last year. We attribute the improved performance of the FBM Small Cap Index this year to its relative underperformance last year and improved risk appetite as the headwinds faced by Asia have reduced.”Areca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong also believes last year’s selldown has created openings for investors looking beyond the benchmark index. Among his pick of sectors to invest in is oil and gas, which has seen a turnaround this year, in line with the recovery in Brent crude prices. “We actually returned to the oil and gas space towards the end of last year as we felt most of the downside had been priced in. Of course, the price of oil plays a role in lifting the mood of investors but what’s important is that we’re also seeing more activities this year,” Wong observes.Coming off last year’s “yo-yo trend” — thanks to the uncertainties raised by production cuts led by Opec+ as well as the tweets of US President Donald Trump on oil prices — Brent crude hit a multi-year high of US$84.93 per barrel in October before slipping to a one-year low of US$50.47 at the end of last year. Prices had inched up to US$67.80 per barrel at the time of writing.Given its average return of 45.5% year to date, oil and gas is the top performing sector so far this year, its upward trend lifting stocks in the category.Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd returned to the black in its financial year ended Dec 31, 2018, with a net profit of RM97.72 million, and has since been rewarded with a 213% surge in its share price.Also impressive is Petra Energy Bhd’s 189% gain after bouncing back into positive territory in its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, with a net profit of RM20.88 million.Other players trending upwards include Uzma Bhd, Velesto Energy Bhd, T7 Global Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd and Sapura Energy Bhd.Notable improvements have also been seen in construction, whose average return is 24.8% year to date. David Loh, senior portfolio manager at Affin Hwang Asset Management, says a possible revival of the East Coast Rail Link has lifted sentiments on the sector, which was hit by a slew of project cancellations last year.“Judging from public statements made by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the project’s cost should drop substantially to below RM30 billion. This can be achieved by tweaking ECRL’s design and lowering its specifications. If you assume 30% local content, the jobs available to Malaysian contractors is only RM9 billion,” he says, adding that as competition for the tender packages is expected to be intense, margins are unlikely to be great.His firm has taken positions in selective construction stocks that are trading far below their asset value. “We believe there is potential in these companies to monetise assets and unlock value for shareholders. Should that happen, management can use the sale proceeds to pay special dividends and pare down borrowings.”There are also signs of interest in companies that were previously shunned by investors for their perceived links with the previous Barisan Nasional (BN) government.KUB Malaysia Bhd, MyEG Services Bhd, Media Prima Bhd and George Kent (M) Bhd are some of the counters that have seen a surge in buying volume.Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau believes small caps will continue to enjoy an uptick but he also points to external risks, including the ongoing US-China trade talks as well as Brexit negotiations. FBM KLCI not reflective of marketTo Areca Capital’s Wong, the FBM KLCI is not reflecting Bursa and has been dragged down by a few notable decliners this year, namely Petronas Dagangan Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Top Glove Corp Bhd.“The benchmark index only consists of 30 companies and it was dragged down by a few heavyweights while the banking sector, which dominates the index, has been relatively flat so far,” he says.For instance, TNB, which has about 9.95% weightage on the FBM KLCI, is down 6.6% year to date while CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (7.38% weightage) has shed 4.6%.An analyst with a local investment bank agrees, saying newcomers to the benchmark index, such as the glove manufacturers as well as Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd, which have done well in the past few years, have been affected by profit-taking activities as their valuations are near historical highs.The top decliners so far among the indice’s component stocks are Hartalega (25%), Top Glove (22%) and Sime Darby Bhd (10%).Genting Bhd and Genting Malaysia Bhd, on the other hand, are the top gainers with a total return of 16.1% and 14.6% respectively, followed by IHH Healthcare Bhd at 9.6%.Despite their strong gains, the total weightage of the three counters only makes up 8% of the benchmark index — less than TNB on its own.With the year just a fortnight shy of its quarter mark, investors are likely to have more to cheer about than to moan, given that 356 counters have posted double-digit gains, 265 counters are on a positive trend and only 224 counters are in the red.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-opportunities-oil-gas-construction

(March 19, RM1.85)
Maintain hold with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM1.66: Sunway Construction Group Bhd (SunCon) is the largest listed construction pure play in Malaysia. Given its strong track record, we think SunCon will remain relevant for public and private sector projects despite the current more challenging construction landscape. SunCon has also established itself as the only construction specialist involved in all three Rapid Line infrastructure projects — the mass rapid transit, light rail transit (LRT) and bus rapid transit. 
At the current valuations, we prefer exposure to the larger-cap contractors trading at cheaper or parity valuations and are more diversified. Until we see a more sustained roll-out in government infrastructure projects, we think purer play contractors such as SunCon should trade at a discount to the larger ones. Still, we acknowledged SunCon’s solid execution track record, net cash balance sheet and sustainable dividend payout.SunCon’s new order wins in financial year 2018 (FY18) moderated to RM1.6 billion after hitting RM4 billion in FY17. Its FY19 forecast new win target has been set at RM1.5 billion with an equal distribution between internal and external jobs. Year-to-date wins amount to RM781 million, including the Tenaga Nasional Bhd project. In our view, a flawless execution track record, a faster recovery in its precast division leading to a potential uplift in earnings and a sustained dividend payout could be the next catalysts for the stock. While we have factored in the reduced contract values for its LRT3 project, the build-up in receivables and collection for the project remains in question.Our TP is based on a sum-of-parts valuation to reflect a growing contribution from its high-margin precast business. We believe pure-play construction players should at least trade at parity to its more diversified larger-cap peers in times of rising government development expenditure. The timely execution of its peak order book is crucial to minimising the risk of any earnings cuts. With its strong execution track record and experience, we believe the group is able to execute the projects in a timely manner. — AllianceDBS Research, March 19",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/precast-recovery-expected-lift-sunway-construction-group-profit

The decision is “less to do with Brexit but more to do with our plans in the near future,” he said.The Malaysian fund, owner of stakes in some of the nation’s biggest listed companies, is seeking to cut nonperforming assets in the wake of a slump in the net worth of its portfolio amid an uncertain global economy. The Brexit drama adds more gloom as the prospect of a clean break with the EU on the March 29 exit deadline unnerves Asian companies.Khazanah’s total returns are represented by growth in net value of its portfolio, which declined 21.6% in 2018 to RM91 billion (US$22 billion). Its assets include stakes in Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.Khazanah, which has a staff of 10 in its London office, will also scale down its operations in Turkey, Shahril said. “We have started to exit the investments we have there” and as such, Khazanah doesn’t require such a big presence, he said, without being more specific.Both the US and China remain very important to Khazanah because “we have a very big interest in technology and so those offices remain relevant,” he said.Shahril, who previously headed the Employees Provident Fund, took over the reins of Khazanah from Azman Mokhtar in August. Following Malaysia’s historic election last May, the new government under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sought a reset of Khazanah which involved a refreshed mandate for the fund.Shahril told Bloomberg Television earlier that while Khazanah will focus on growing Malaysia’s assets base for the long term, it has no plans to pull back on its overseas investments as it seeks to optimize risk-adjusted returns over a 10-year period.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/khazanah-mulls-closing-london-office
"March 20, 2019 09:48 am +08",TENAGA,"Listing unlisted GLCs will improve operations — fund managers","KUALA LUMPUR: The government’s plan to list some of its matured unlisted entities is a good move albeit not a surprising one, which could drive these government-linked companies (GLCs) to operate more efficiently once they are put under public scrutiny, said fund managers.Moody’s Investors Service analyst Anushka Shah said the divestment of GLCs is not a new initiative, pointing out that it was the cornerstone of the 10-year GLC Transformation Programme which was concluded in 2015.“Listing GLCs may bring some benefits in terms of greater transparency and disclosure standards, achieving a greater balance between the public and private sectors, and better governance,” she told The Edge Financial Daily.Anushka, however, pointed out that asset divestments generally lack predictability.Speaking at the two-day Invest Malaysia conference yesterday, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia’s matured unlisted government entities may be listed on the stock market, with the government also looking into some of its shareholdings in GLCs, indicating that it may cut its stakes in certain listed companies.He said this is to ensure greater risk control parameters for issuances of government guarantees, better market access and identification of opportunities of potential asset monetisation, adding that GLCs will play “certain catalytic roles to support the economy”.MIDF Research head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman said corporatising GLCs could be a good move, seeing how Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM) and Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s (TNB) operations had transformed from their previous incarnations as Jabatan Telekom and Lembaga Letrik Negara respectively.“Looking at TM and TNB, from just being government departments previously, they have grown leaps and bounds in playing an active role in the development of the telecommunications and power sectors.“They [currently] finance their own capex (capital expenditure) needs without burdening the government’s coffers while providing opportunities to many entrepreneurs to join as vendors and resellers,” he said.In terms of potential candidates that could see a listing, Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng said there are many companies that could be candidates, based on the high number of companies under government-linked investment companies such as Khazanah Nasional Bhd and Permodalan Nasional Bhd.He added that units of Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) could also be potential candidates.However, Ang said, the GLCs that the government intends to list must be companies that investors are interested in, in order to get good value.“It must be something that investors want. If it is just listings for the sake of listings, the government will not get good valuation as people will not be interested to invest. The government has to see where the demand is in the market and then look at which companies it can list and sell at a good price,” he said.Astramina Advisory Sdn Bhd managing director Wong Muh Rong concurred that Petronas is a likely candidate, given that it is a world-class company with reputable governance, comparing it to Saudi Arabia’s national oil and gas company Saudi Aramco which is also planning an initial public offering in 2021.“The government does not need to let go of a substantial portion of its shareholdings as they can already raise a lot of funds just by monetising a 20% to 30% stake in Petronas.“Petronas is a good candidate. It is not difficult to sell and the government can get fairly good upfront money and use it to boost market activity,” said Wong.On the other hand, another fund manager, who declined to be named, said it is unlikely that an offer for Petronas would be on the table but noted that the government could start divesting its holdings in some of the relatively smaller companies first.“I don’t think the government will list Petronas as it is considered a strategic asset. They can still monetise [it] but maybe just a minority stake or a division under the group,” said the fund manager.He pointed to Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera’s portfolio which includes Affin Bank Bhd and Boustead Holdings Bhd, and said that the government could test the water with the sale of smaller stakes to see how the market reacts before touching the bigger investments.Socio-Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie said the investments that could potentially be disposed of depend on the government’s definition of “matured assets”.“Based on Khazanah’s new mandate, it seems to be referring to businesses that can already stand on their own feet, with decent price-to-book that no longer needs institutional funds as anchor investors.“The companies that come to mind in terms of monetisation could be CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, TM and other companies in the utility and aviation sectors,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/listing-unlisted-glcs-will-improve-operations-%E2%80%94-fund-managers

"March 18, 2019 17:00 pm +08",TENAGA,"Who’s right about Khazanah’s 2018 (under)performance?","EVIDENTLY, billion-ringgit headline losses were too good an opportunity to gain political mileage to let slip, going by the heated social media exchanges between Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali and former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak last week.When it comes to reported numbers, Najib — who was chairman of Khazanah Nasional Bhd until May 31 last year — is not wrong in saying that the sovereign wealth fund’s RM6.271 billion pre-tax losses for 2018 were the first it has reported in over a decade.Yet, part of the reason for last year’s underperformance was Khazanah’s portfolio of assets, which was concentrated in a handful of companies it had long invested in. The concentration risk was partly why Khazanah needed to rebalance its portfolio to deliver on its new mandate of growing Malaysia’s long-term wealth.A strategic review of its investments resulted in a RM7.3 billion impairment provision for 2018.“Roughly half” of the RM7.3 billion impairment was due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd, which Khazanah nationalised in 2014 after paying RM1.4 billion for the remaining 30% stake it did not own.Had that sizeable impairment for the loss-making national carrier been deemed necessary in 2017, Khazanah’s total impairment that year would have been nearer to RM5.95 billion — more than double the RM2.3 billion it booked that year. An impairment of that size would have wiped out the fund’s RM2.896 billion pre-tax profits for 2017 and resulted in two straight years of losses, back-of-the-envelope calculations show. Kitchen-sinking?Khazanah does not expect any large impairments to take place this year, even as Malaysia Airlines goes through another round of strategic review to improve its performance.“Khazanah should be able to return to profit [in 2019], given the fact that the clean-up we did in 2018 has gone through the books,” managing director Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan said on March 5 when presenting the company’s annual review. He also provided more details on its dual-basket — strategic and commercial — investment fund structure, objectives and targets.The sovereign wealth fund will need at least five to seven years to rebalance its portfolio into one that can sustainably provide consistent supplementary income to the government, Shahril told The Edge in a recent interview. Apart from supporting the government’s developmental goals via its strategic investments, its commercial fund will be more diversified in terms of asset allocation, sector and geography.As it is, its portfolio concentration risk can also be seen from its so-called net worth adjusted (NWA) value where one-third of the RM25 billion or 21.6% year-on-year decline to RM91 billion as at end-2018 came from two companies — Axiata Group Bhd (-RM5 billion) and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (-RM3.5 billion).Other sizeable downward NWA adjustments were made for its holdings in Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-RM1.9 billion), IHH Healthcare Bhd (-RM1.9 billion), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-RM1.5 billion) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (-RM200 million). The six made up RM14 billion or 56% of Khazanah’s NWA decline. Domestic factors, dealsWhile global markets underperformed last year on the back of geopolitical tension and pessimism over growth in emerging markets, Khazanah’s portfolio performance was further hampered by domestic developments, including regulatory changes, subdued earnings outlook and market volatility.To be sure, the headline RM6.271 billion pre-tax losses for 2018 are sizeable.Still, the RM7.3 billion (non-cash) impairment does not affect Khazanah’s cash flow position and capacity to pay RM1.5 billion in dividend for 2018. The fund received RM2.8 billion in dividends and booked RM1.4 billion divestment gains last year, down from RM3.1 billion in dividends and RM2.8 billion divestment gains in 2017.Khazanah paid RM30 million in dividend in 2005 when it reported a RM831 million pre-tax loss. It paid RM100 million in dividend in 2008 when it reported a RM223 million net loss in 2018. For 2019, the guidance is for “RM1 billion to RM1.5 billion” in dividend.It is understood that Khazanah’s sale of a 16% stake in IHH to Mitsui & Co Ltd for RM8.42 billion, which is targeted to be completed by end-March, is still awaiting foreign regulatory approval. According to Shahril, the proceeds will be used to rebalance its portfolio to generate greater returns for the country.A separate 26% stake in IHH is up for sale at the right price, as long as it does not destroy the value of the remaining holdings in Khazanah’s commercial basket. Other assets in the basket include its holdings in CIMB, Axiata and Alibaba.com as well as private assets such as The Holstein Milk Co, Sun Life Malaysia, WeLab and Palantir.Meanwhile, assets in its strategic basket are Malaysia Airlines, Telekom Malaysia, Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia Airports and PLUS Malaysia Bhd. Developmental assets such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Themed Attractions Resorts & Hotels Sdn Bhd (TARH), Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and Medini Iskandar Malaysia Sdn Bhd are also in this basket where economic benefits to the country also count as returns.It remains to be seen if UK-listed Merlin Entertainments plc, which makes money from operating Le­goland Malaysia on behalf of TARH, would buy a stake in the asset from Khazanah — just like how Mitsui had increased its stake in IHH by buying more shares from Kha­zanah. Talk of the potential sale of Legoland or an IPO of Khazanah’s theme parks had been circulating for some years.While Shahril said Khazanah was “not in talks with anyone and there are no offers on the table” when asked about the sale of Le­goland, he did not dismiss the possibility. “Everything has a value at the end of the day and if a great valuation comes in, we will look and see whether the capital that can be returned to our books can be better deployed in other areas,” he said, noting that Legoland is already profitable.Apart from behaving more like a portfolio manager to derive greater returns on its commercial assets, Khazanah is also targeting better cost-efficiency by cutting its cost-to-realisable asset value (RAV) ratio from 50 basis points in 2018 to 30 to 35 basis points in 2023. Part of this could come as it vacates premium office space at the Petronas Twin Towers in favour of transit-oriented Mercu UEM in KL Sentral. Khazanah, which has a long-term lease for 11,500 sq ft at The Shard in London, also has offices in Istanbul, Beijing, Mumbai and San Francisco.“Some of our offices are quite vital to our operations, like China, for example … we need people on the ground to ensure those assets are managed well and are creating value for Khazanah as a whole. Some of the other offices, for instance in London, may be less important because we will be adopting a more market-driven approach … if there is a cost benefit to us by running the international offices in a different way, we will make those decisions as we go along,” Shahril said.If Khazanah succeeds in becoming a significant revenue contributor to the government, there will be more money to improve the people’s well-being and less pressure to raise taxes. For the electorate, tangible benefits from sound public policy should ring truer than fleeting attention on social media.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/whos-right-about-khazanahs-2018-underperformance

"March 18, 2019 07:00 am +08",TENAGA,"Building trust is not just the CEO’s job","For businesses and corporates, trust is a powerful currency that is often attached to their management’s reputation, among other things.Hence the aftermath of the 14th general election (GE14) in May 2018, when Corporate Malaysia saw many abrupt changes at the helm of larger companies that, eventually, turned the spotlight on the affected businesses.Among the questions that arose were how should companies protect the trust they have amid unplanned leadership shifts, and how should they mitigate any impact on confidence such changes has had.The answer is to consider the long-term effect when it comes to trust, according to PwC Malaysia managing partner Sridharan Nair, or Sri as he is known.An organisation that has built up its reservoir of trust and embedded it as part of corporate values can stand the test of time regardless of leadership changes, Sri explains.“There is a saying that consistency is the true foundation of trust. So if you do not have that consistency in an organisation, then this raises doubts [among stakeholders].“So, a balance has to be struck — the person whose face is on the front is the leader, but it is the organisation which [provides support], so it is not just what the leader says but how the group behaves as well,” he adds.That said, the onus of building confidence — or renewing it, as the case may be — lies with a company’s management that is often seen as its face as well.And the leader needs the backing of the organisation to be successful in doing that, says Sri.“The tone at the top needs to be set, essentially, to say ‘we need to promote integrity at the highest levels all the way through the organisation’,” he tells The Edge.“However, it is not just about rolling out a plan or initiative; it is how you see it through, from the actions to the enforcement of it [throughout the organisation],” he adds.The growing spotlight on the role of leadership in trust is accorded consideration in the PwC Malaysia Building Trust Awards, which returns this year for the third time since its inaugural edition back in 2015.The biennial awards recognise companies that are making significant moves in building integrity through their communications and interactions with stakeholders.To recap, no submissions or nominations are accepted for the awards. Instead, only the top 50 Malaysian public-listed companies (PLCs) on Bursa Malaysia by market capitalisation are considered.The annual reports of these 50 companies are then benchmarked against the International Integrated Reporting Council’s framework (refer to Methodology). This would be based on the latest available annual reports as of June 2018. Following this, a total of 20 companies are then shortlisted. For this year, the 20 finalists listed in alphabetical order are: AirAsia Group Bhd, Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, BIMB Holdings Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Digi.com Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, IOI Corp Bhd, KLCCP Stapled Group, Malayan Banking Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Maxis Bhd, MISC Bhd, Petronas, RHB Bank Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, Sunway Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Bhd.PwC Malaysia assurance and people partner Pauline Ho says on top of the existing assessment methodology, an additional survey was introduced this year as part of three dimensions of measuring trust perception in collaboration with The Iclif Leadership and Governance Centre (Iclif).According to Ho, the extra survey looks at trust in leadership as the first dimension. The review is designed for an organisation’s employees to answer questions surrounding leadership and their confidence in their company’s leadership team.For the second dimension, PwC conducts an independent survey via a third party to comb through online sources of data for conversations about trust on the 20 shortlisted organisations in order to build a trust profile for each.“The third dimension is a public poll, which is open to the public until March 31, 2019, where we get anyone who is not working within the organisation to comment on whether these [companies] are building trust,” says Ho.“[Through this] we have these different perspectives so that we not only listen to what the companies say about themselves, but also what employees think about their leadership and what the third parties are saying, as well as the public opinion,” Ho concludes.The findings will then be deliberated on by an independent panel of four judges who will select the winners.Rounding up the 2019 Building Trust Awards panel of judges are Sir David Tweedie who is the chairman of the board of trustees of the International Valuation Standards Council and past chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board; Tan Sri Dr Jemilah Mahmood who is under secretary general, partnerships at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; Malek Ali, who is the founder of BFM 89.9; and Nadiah Wan, the group CEO of TMC Life Sciences Bhd and CEO of the Thomson Hospital, Kota Damansara.The results will be revealed at an awards ceremony to be held in Kuala Lumpur, which is scheduled to take place in the second half of the year.This year, PwC also engaged the growing start-up community to understand their perspective on trust. However, start-up organisations are not part of the awards, which are currently meant for PLCs only.From the engagement, it is clear that large corporates can draw important lessons from start-ups on how to protect trust, which is vital to any start-up’s long-term survival, says Sri.“If they (start-ups) cannot get that (trust management) right, they believe that they are not going to be able to survive as a business. And I think that is probably a lesson for larger corporates where as you get bigger, you may have other priorities such as expansion or other engagement with stakeholders and shareholders as opposed to which segment actually makes your business work, which is the consumers who buy your products or services,” says Sri.“So we have seen the larger corporates refocusing on consumers and customers over the years. Their focus is on consumers and making sure that they get their consumers to believe in their idea and to address and to be very responsive to those consumers’ comments as well,” he adds.Interestingly, many start-ups feel that it is easier to boost trust as a big business, Sri reflects. On the other hand, start-ups also believe they can build up their trust reservoir through technology much faster, he adds.“They also believe that in the start-up phase, they can connect with the consumers quicker and in a more authentic manner than much more established businesses.“And, for established businesses, when you go into something that is new, it is more difficult to build trust because you are seen as this sort of business and doing this sort of thing, [but] trying to venture into something new.”In any case, the growing trust awareness in the business ecosystem in Malaysia is positive given that the private sector is a key driver of the economy, Sri says.“At the end of the day, it is about having businesses, corporates and start-ups, having the dialogue and discussion about the importance of trust. Businesses have a big role to play, and if we are able to raise the bar on how important trust is, then we are heading in the right direction.”To participate in the online poll, please visit http://bit.ly/pwctrustpoll 2019. CEOs weigh in on trust...As a leader, how do you inspire a culture of trust in Maybank?
Trust is ultimately about aligning personal and collective interests of a group to a pre-agreed destination — relying on each individual to do his part, so that the outcome is greater than the sum of the parts. The challenge is to ensure agreement among members that group interests should always take precedence over personal ones. It is ultimately a balancing act that needs to be monitored constantly.— Datuk Abdul Farid Alias,
Group President & CEO,
Malayan Banking Bhd (winning company of the 2015 awards) How did Sime Darby Group sustain employee trust amidst the leadership changes following the demerger?
With the new leadership team in place, we set out to meet with groups of employees across our operations. These sessions were essentially open platforms for employees to air any concerns or questions they had, and for them to share their thoughts and ideas for the new organisation. They also provided us the opportunity to communicate our new vision, strategy and targets, and to project the new culture for Sime Darby Bhd.  — Datuk Jeffri Salim Davidson,
Group CEO,
Sime Darby Bhd (winning company of the 2017 awards) How can leaders articulate trust in a simple yet meaningful manner to their employees?  
For leaders to express trust to their employees, there must be commitment to a purpose that entails creating a better future for their people. Not only is it important for employees to know that their leader is committed to a worthy purpose; the leader must pursue that purpose based on the right set of values.  Deeply held values play a huge role in earning trust. Earning the trust of one’s employees is not just a soft, nice-to-have asset; it is the hard currency that makes a difference between success and failure.How can leaders build trust for their organisation’s long-lasting success?
Leaders build trust for their organisations through their actions – by setting direction that creates meaningful value for their stakeholders and enables empowered decision-making. In addition, leaders focus on designing the structures, deploying the right resources and supporting systems to execute the strategy. Underpinning all this, is the accountability for creating a culture of long-lasting excellence based on the right values and leading by example.—  Rajeev Peshawaria,

Those five years of losses have eaten up RM901 million of retained profit.Given that, it is not surprising that Mudajaya is not appealing to investors although the stock has tumbled to 30.5 sen — the lowest level since November 2006. The stock was trading at the RM2.60 level five years ago.Although Mudajaya is not a hot stock on Bursa Malaysia currently, the group is participating in major infrastructure projects, including the Mass Rapid Transit  (MRT) Line 2 and Light Rail Transit (LRT) Line 3. Mudajaya has also secured a number of civil work contracts that were worth over RM1 billion at refinery and petrochemical integrated development project in Pengerang, southern Johor.The group’s order book is currently at slightly more than RM1 billion.“Our local operation is profitable but it is shadowed by the impairment that we booked in for the operation in India,” said its chief executive officer James Wong. “We are currently tendering jobs to replenish our order book.”Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Wong said, the group is expected to return to the black in the second half of the current financial year ending Dec 31, 2019 (FY19), judging by the current project orders in hand and the performance of its recurring income-generating assets.For FY18, Mudajaya’s net loss swelled to a record high of RM402.4 million versus RM120.8 million the year before. Its revenue, however, grew 40% to RM762.6 million from RM545.3 million in FY17.The group incurred impairment of RM145.5 million in FY18, in addition to its share of losses in an associated company amounting to RM213.1 million. Operation-wise, it generated an operating income of RM47.38 million compared with RM76.28 million a year ago.Wong explained that the impairments in FY18 are primarily related to the IPP (independent power producer) project in India due to the impact of the proposed restructuring plan of power assets under the Reserve Bank of India framework.“With the completion of testing and commission of Unit IV by March this year, the construction phase of the IPP project will be considered fully completed.“The outstanding challenges that remain will be to secure a PPA (power purchase agreement) for Unit IV and its associated working capital,” said Wong.He expects further share of losses in the next two financial quarters in the Indian operation. The losses are mainly from depreciation and interest cost of the completed units but have yet to commence power sales.The group’s venture into the Indian power production industry goes as far back as in 2009. It initially brought high hopes that the electricity production project in the continent, where power shortage is acute, would be a cash cow generating steady cash flow and recurring income to Mudajaya.The group took up a 26% stake in RKM Powergen Pvt Ltd — a joint venture with India’s RK Powergen & Associate — to undertake the construction of the power plant in Chhattisgarh state, with an estimated investment of RM5 billion.However, it was never smooth sailing. The project encountered a host of challenges, including securing coal supply and renegotiating a PPA due to change of government policy there.According to Wong, the first three units of the power plant have already secured a PPA through an open tender process.“Notwithstanding this, we remain confident that the IPP project in India will generate positive results once power sales from all four units commence in the near future,” he said.Beside India, Mudajaya owns a 46% stake in PT Harmoni Energy Indonesia which runs a power plant in Sulawesi.On the home front, the group has set its foothold in solar farming. Its solar photovoltaic power plant of 49MW in Sungai Siput, Perak, has achieved commercial operation in late November last year. It has signed a 21-year power purchase agreement with Tenaga Nasional Bhd.Commenting on the group’s balance sheet, Wong acknowledges that the concern on its high gearing at above 200% and its potential impact to the group’s credit standing. But he stresses that the current level of gearing is “manageable”.“With the improvement in the performance of our ongoing businesses, this will continue to strengthen our equity base.“In addition, the management is actively looking at streamlining its balance sheet by monetising its non-core assets to pare down its borrowing and also explore options on [a] corporate exercise to beef up its capital base and meet its funding and investment needs,” Wong explained.After years of disappointments, analysts and fund managers might not pin much hope on Mudajaya’s power project in India. Some reckon there could still be a long passage before the power plant starts contributing to the bottom line.Nonetheless, Mudajaya has not given up. In Wong’s opinion, this could just be the last mile in the cross-country run after having tumbled into a rough patch.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mudajaya-sees-ray-hope-turning-around

"March 06, 2019 08:31 am +08",TENAGA,"Khazanah posts first pre-tax loss since 2005","KUALA LUMPUR: Khazanah Nasional Bhd posted its first pre-tax loss in 13 years in 2018, amid significant impairment provisions made during the year — a big chunk of which was due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAB) — but hopes to return to profitability in 2019.The sovereign wealth fund reported a pre-tax loss of RM6.3 billion for 2018, compared to its pre-tax profit of RM2.9 billion in the preceding year, after recording impairments totalling RM7.3 billion — more than triple the RM2.3 billion seen in 2017.The last time it fell into the red was in 2005, when the fund reported a pre-tax loss of RM831 million.Khazanah managing director (MD) Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan said the sizeable impairment reflected the drop in market value of the share prices of listed stocks the fund holds, as well as the decline in the fair carrying value of some of its unlisted assets.“Our performance in 2018 was impacted by several key global and domestic developments in both the economic and social spheres. At the same time, the government initiated a reset of Khazanah, which involved significant changes including a refreshed mandate,” he said at the Khazanah annual review yesterday.The fund received RM2.8 billion in dividends from its investments in 2018, down 9.7% from the RM3.1 billion it recorded in the previous year, while divestment gains halved to RM1.4 billion for the year from RM2.8 billion, reflecting the challenging market conditions during the year.“Looking ahead into 2019, Khazanah should be able to return to profit, given the fact that the clean-up we did in 2018 has gone through the books. We don’t expect any more large impairments that we have to go through again in 2018.“The provisions are primarily due to Malaysia Airlines Bhd, which accounted for roughly half of the total impairments for 2018,” he said.Its portfolio’s realisable asset value (RAV) — or the market value of all equities, securities and cash held — fell to RM136 billion in 2018 from RM157 billion a year ago. In terms of net worth adjusted — which is RAV less total liabilities and adjusted to measure value created — that fell 21.6% to RM91 billion from RM116 billion, weighed by subdued earnings outlook, market volatility and regulatory changes. Challenging conditions in the airline industryShahril said the airline industry is challenging, as he pointed to persistent overcapacity and how airlines in the country, such as the region’s leading low-cost airline AirAsia Bhd, are also struggling.While Malaysia Airlines was a drag on Khazanah’s financials for 2018, he justified the fund’s investment in the airline by saying that it provides other economic benefits to the country beyond the fund’s bottom line. As an example, he cited the connectivity it provides that brings business and leisure travellers into Malaysia, which indirectly contributes to the economy.However, he said that does not discount the fact that the national airline should be as operationally efficient as possible.“Quite clearly, the strategy put in place for Malaysia Airlines has not met its objectives. That is a fact we have to acknowledge. The question now is whether it makes sense to continue with the same strategy or do we need to rethink how the airline operates given the challenging environment?“We are waiting for Malaysia Airlines to complete its review and we will be looking at understanding what that startegy requires,” he said. Drop in TM’s market valueAnother factor that drove Khazanah into the red was Telekom Malaysia Bhd (TM), which saw a substantial fall in market value following the 83% drop in the group’s net profit for 2018, which Shahril attributed to regulatory changes.TM registered a 56.9% decline in total returns, the biggest decliner in Khazanah’s portfolio, followed by Axiata Group Bhd (-26.9%), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-9.3%), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (-7.9%), IHH Healthcare Bhd (-7.6%) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (-3.3%).Shahril said the market has priced in the fact that TM will take some time to improve its cost base, following the government’s move to bring down consumer pricing as quickly as possible.As the telecommunications company shifts its pricing to reflect the new regulatory environment, revenue will be affected, he said, but added that profitability will return given time. Portfolio rebalancing to spread risk concentrationMeanwhile, Shahril said the fund will remain focused on executing its portfolio rebalancing strategy and strengthening its financial position.He stressed that Khazanah is looking at long-term returns and that it is natural for there to be fluctuations in the market over long periods of time, especially since the fund’s portfolio is very much equity-based. “The key thing to focus on is the fact that we are restructuring the portfolio and are geared towards long-term returns,” Shahril said.The portfolio rebalancing, he said, will look at taking out some of the inherent risks in its portfolio, such as the concentration of risk it is facing given that a big chunk of its investments in Malaysia are tied up in just a few companies. So, over time, Khazanah will have a more balanced portfolio spread over more sectors and geographies to mitigate the concentration of risk, and benefit from a more diversified portfolio.Khazanah is also splitting its portfolio into two — commercial and strategic. The commercial portion targets returns equivalent to inflation plus 3% on a five-year rolling basis. It will comprise public assets such as CIMB, Axiata, IHH and Alibaba.com as well as private assets such as The Holstein Milk Company Sdn Bhd, Sun Life Malaysia, WeLab and Palantir.The strategic portion is a developmental fund targeting returns equivalent to the 10-year Malaysian Government Securities yield on a five-year rolling basis. It includes strategic assets such as TM, TNB, MAB and PLUS Malaysia Bhd and developmental assets such as Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Iskandar Investment Bhd, Themed Attractions Resorts & Hotels Sdn Bhd, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and Medini Iskandar Malaysia.Meanwhile, as part of the review of the fund’s operational costs, Khazanah is looking at the operations of its international offices and may take steps to improve their operations.“Some of our offices are quite vital to our operations, like China, for example. We have a lot of investments in the country and a lot of these are private equity investments, so we need people on the ground to ensure those assets are managed well and are creating value for Khazanah as a whole.“Some of the other offices, for instance in London, may be less important because we will be adopting a more market-driven approach. So, we can do more of the operations out of other offices. As we review our costs and business operations, if there is a cost benefit to us by running the international offices in a different way, we will make those decisions as we go along,” he said. Not in talks with any party for Legoland saleMeanwhile, when asked if Khazanah had received offers for Legoland Malaysia Resort — following a news report that the fund is looking to sell the theme park — Shahril said Khazanah is not in talks with any party, though the the fund is reviewing all its assets.“Legoland is not only Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) positive — it’s returning a positive profit as well. The time will come when we need to think about reinvesting the capital.“Everything has a value at the end of the day and if a great valuation comes in, we will look and see whether the capital that can be returned to our books can be better deployed in other areas,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/khazanah-posts-first-pretax-loss-2005

The remainder 60% in BHP is owned by Sabah-based Warisan Tarang Construction Sdn Bhd, which The Edge Malaysia weekly previously reported was perceived to be connected to Sabah Umno and former Chief Minister Tan Sri Musa Aman.MMC said the termination is on the grounds of national interest, and will take effect five months from April 22.Far East Holdings Bhd is proposing to acquire 2,134 hectares of oil palm plantation land in Rompin, Pahang, and a palm oil mill from Harn Len Corp Bhd for RM182.99 million cash.Far East said it will fund the acquisition through internally-generated funds.The group said the palm oil mill has a capacity of 40 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches per hour.Far East said the proposed acquisition is in line with its expansion plan and will broaden the group’s income base through increased plantation acreage at a ""reasonable"" cost and at a strategic location.Public Bank Bhd posted a marginal 0.34% increase in first-quarter net profit to RM1.41 billion from RM1.405 billion a year ago, mainly due to lower loan impairment allowance of RM71.7 million and higher investment income of RM38.1 million.Earnings per share was down slightly to 36.32 sen for 1QFY19 compared with 36.39 sen for 1QFY18.

Earnings per share slipped to 5.8 sen versus 7.9 sen a year earlier.Bursa said while 1Q2019 was a weak quarter for the exchange, this was consistent with the prevailing domestic and global developments which included concerns of slower economic growth, weaker corporate earnings and palm oil prices.Kimlun Corp Bhd has bagged an RM204.4 million contract to build two blocks of apartments in Selangor.Kimlun said its wholly-owned Kimlun Sdn Bhd secured the job from Rexpoint Resources Sdn Bhd.

"April 29, 2019 14:00 pm +08",AIRASIA,"Lead Story: Adopt trading strategy, experts advise","WITH the FBM KLCI falling to a two-year low of 1,619.73 last Thursday, in sharp contrast to the recovery seen in other equity markets in the region, a trading strategy is the way to go amid uncertainty on the domestic and external fronts.And if you think putting your money in fixed deposit is a good defensive strategy, the latest news on a potential downgrade of Malaysian bonds by FTSE Russell in its World Government Bond Index (WGBI) has sparked heavy selling in the local bond market, leading to a spike in the benchmark 10-year Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) yield to 3.94% last Thursday from 3.78% on Monday.The weaker performance of the FBM KLCI came amid a strong recovery in some of the small and mid-cap stocks during the first quarter following a sharp selldown towards the end of last year.Sectors such as construction and oil and gas (O&G) have rallied strongly despite the FBM KLCI’s underperformance. The technology sector is also back on investors’ radar screens after a lacklustre performance last year.But with 2018’s beaten down stocks already making a strong recovery in the first three months of the year, as well as the strong rally seen in the O&G and construction sectors, where are the trading opportunities?“We looked and analysed our coverage universe and see four strategies on the stocks we like, premised on market velocity (market cap churn) and volatility (share price volatility),” says MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman.The first strategy targets stocks with velocity above 40%, signalling that these counters are sufficiently liquid, with price volatility above 15%, giving what Redza calls a trading quadrant.“Some of the stocks we like in this category include MyEG Services Bhd, which is likely to continue its business albeit at a lower margin; Gabungan AQRS Bhd as a potential beneficiary of the East Coast Rail Link works as well as tracks passing through Kota Sultan Ahmad Shah township; Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd on its maintenance, construction and modification contracts and potential upside from Perdana Petroleum Bhd; and AirAsia Group Bhd for its strong load factor with higher percentage hedging for its fuel supplies to see more manageable costs,” he notes, adding that investors can easily buy and sell these counters given their high liquidity and defensive earnings with upside opportunities.MIDF Research sees counters with high volatility but lower velocity (below 40%) as an opportunistic play as well.“These strategies aim at counters that lack liquidity and have large price movements. It could be a good time to buy in when market sentiment turns negative,” Redza says, pointing to Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd, KKB Engineering Bhd (both are Sarawak plays) and MMC Corp Bhd (multi-utilities play).RHB Research Institute head of Malaysian research Alexander Chia, on the other hand, believes that rotational interest will still depend on developments in the external macro environment.“The easing of the ringgit and possibility of a US-China trade deal will see interest rotate back into the technology sector. The improvement in China’s economy will be positive for technology players, plantation companies, the aviation industry as well as the tourism sector,” Chia says.He believes that despite a strong rally seen in the construction sector as well as the Genting group, there is still upside in these stocks.“First-quarter results will be an important signpost for Genting as it will provide clarity on the uncertainty of the impact of the gaming tax. I think there will also be continued interest in the small and mid caps given the expensive large cap valuations,” Chia says.For the large caps, Chia believes the main uncertainty remains on whether there is more foreign portfolio selling to be done. “Big caps with high foreign shareholdings are unlikely to perform until the foreign selling abates,” he says.Indeed, a quick check reveals that foreign net selling continued until last Wednesday, although the exact amount was uncertain at the time of writing. Based on MIDF’s latest weekly fund flow report dated April 15 for the week ended April 12, Malaysia saw the largest foreign net outflow of the four Asean markets monitored, with a net outflow of RM2.05 billion on a year-to-date basis. In fact, out of the 15 weeks so far this year, international funds have been net sellers on Bursa for nine.Jeremy Goh, Hong Leong Investment Bank head of research, agrees that external uncertainties will play an important role and that investment angles in the upcoming quarters will be tilted towards an expectation that central banks around the world will continue to signal a dovish tone.“It is now a forgone conclusion that two of the key external uncertainties will persist into 2Q2019. A soft deadline for the US-China trade talks has been set for early May while Brexit has been extended to Oct 31. With these uncertainties extending into 2Q2019, we reckon that major central banks (US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank) will continue with their dovish tone. For Malaysia, while we do not expect an Overnight Policy Rate cut in the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting (May 6 and 7), we reckon that Bank Negara Malaysia will continue with a dovish tilt, similar to the March MPC tone,” Goh says.With dovish expectations, he points out that high-yielding dividend plays and real estate investment trusts (REITs) could garner interest.“We like IGB REIT among the large caps and MRCB-Quill REIT for small caps. For those seeking large-cap liquid yielders, we like Malayan Banking Bhd, which offers about a 6.5% yield. Other high dividend yielders that we favour include Bermaz Auto Bhd, Taliworks Corp Bhd and Lii Hen Industries Bhd, but those are within the small to mid-cap space,” Goh says.He adds that with the ringgit expected to end weaker in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, export plays should also be in favour. For export plays, the research house recommends Top Glove Corp Bhd.The ringgit is the worst-performing currency in Asia so far in April.Maybank Investment Bank Research head of research Wong Chew Hann agrees that the ringgit and interest rate direction will influence trading themes in the upcoming quarters.“Trading thematics to look out for in the second and third quarters include the ringgit’s direction and volatility, interest rate direction, high-yielding dividend stocks and more active enforcement against illegal ‘sin’ operators,” Wong says. Suggested trading themes•    Tech players, plantations, aviation, tourism, Genting group, construction•    High-yielding counters or REITs•    Export play on weaker ringgit•    Tech players on weaker ringgit and US-China trade deal•    Recovery of China’s economy — plantation, aviation, tourism•    Genting group — better clarity on impact of gaming tax from 1Q results•    Construction as mega infrastructure projects resume at lower cost•    Small to mid-cap space•    Stocks with high liquidity and price volatility — MyEG, Gabungan AQRS, Dayang, AirAsia•     Stocks with large price movements but lacking in liquidity — Cahya Mata Sarawak, KKB Engineering, MMC Corp ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-adopt-trading-strategy-experts-advise

"April 29, 2019 11:30 am +08",AIRASIA,"Health is Wealth: Making better health more accessible to all","Serial entrepreneur Azran Osman-Rani has spent more than 15 years building brands that provide the mass market with more affordable products and services. These include low-cost airline AirAsia X and video-on-demand service iflix.Recently, Azran turned his focus to health. He wants better health to be an attainable goal for all and he wants to do this through digital therapeutics.Health has always been his personal passion, says Azran. About 14 years ago, he was overweight and unhealthy. He had also lost his father and family members to diabetes, cancer and heart disease. Chronic diseases run strongly in his family, he adds.“I did a DNA analysis on myself several years ago and found that I have the obesity gene, hypertension gene and high-cholesterol gene — basically the all-in-one package. I know that I am not alone. I am a typical Malaysian example,” says Azran.“We are the most unhealthy nation in Asia. Two-thirds of Malaysian adults are at risk of chronic diseases. Almost half the population is overweight and half the working population have mental health challenges.”The challenge here is not everyone has the resources or access to the level of care needed to change their lives for the better, he adds. Only a fraction of the population can afford to have a personal coach, a therapist and a personal physician. The majority of Malaysians have to be in long queues and wait months to finally be able to sit down with a specialist to talk about their health and well-being.While Azran thought that the problem was prevalent, he did not have a solution back then. So, he kept this on the backburner until he visited some former university mates in San Francisco a few years ago.They were working for a company called Omada Health. It provided online coaching programmes to help everyday Americans prevent chronic health issues such as diabetes using a mix of behavioral science, user design and human interaction.“If you think about it, they were trying to solve the same problem that we had been trying to over at AirAsia X and iflix, that is, to provide the service to the mass market. When we started iflix, more than 100 investors rejected us because they said we did not stand a chance against Netflix,” says Azran.“What the investors did not realise was that these were not iflix’s target demographic, they were Netflix’s — those who love sophisticated English-language shows, which they watch on a big flat television screen in the living room with a fibre broadband connection of 100Mbps. That is not how 80% of Malaysians and 90% of Indonesians live. iflix created a product that people could watch on their phone with 3G connection and it provided more locally relevant content. That was how iflix scaled very rapidly.”This was very similar to Omada Health’s situation, he points out. The company was not trying to serve a specific population, it was trying to make better health more accessible to all. So, he took this as inspiration and tried to validate the idea back home by talking to key industry leaders.That was when Azran saw the statistics — chronic diseases are an unbridled double-digit growth expenditure. Although many parties have tried to bring costs down via prevention awareness campaigns, none have been significantly successful as the problem does not lie in awareness and education, he says.“The problem lies in the behaviour gap. When someone gets diagnosed by a doctor and told that he is diabetic, he is told to change his diet, manage his lifestyle, cut down on stress and take medications. But a whopping 74% of these people do not actually follow the advice. When they leave the hospital, there is no one stopping them from returning to their old lifestyles.“When they are home, there is no one stopping them from lighting another cigarette. Their physicians cannot do anything to prevent them from going out with their friends and hanging out at a mamak stall for supper and sugary drinks.”To solve this problem, Azran proposed setting up Naluri, a digital therapeutics service that assigns an individual a professional health coach who will check in with him regularly online. It also provides users with structured programmes that are personalised to their emotional, mental and physical needs. The goal is to help users achieve better health outcomes by building the necessary mental resilience to cope with their specific health challenges.Digital therapeutics is an emerging health discipline that uses technology to augment or even replace active drugs in disease treatment. According to non-profit trade association Digital Therapeutics Alliance, service providers deliver evidence-based therapeutic interventions to patients that are driven by high-quality software programmes to prevent, manage or treat medical disorders or diseases. These are used independently or in concert with medications, devices or other therapies to optimise patient care and health outcomes.A report released by PwC early this year revealed that investors poured a staggering US$12.5 billion into digital health ventures in 2017 and 2018. This was largely due to the digital therapeutics segment which, when paired with Internet of Things devices, has continued to see tremendous growth. Compared with 2013, this level of investment represents an increase of 230% in funding, says the report.With the aim of providing psychological help, Naluri started with a team of qualified psychologists who had been trained to deal with the pressures of chronic diseases and lifestyle changes, says Azran. “Most people tend to associate psychologists with clinical mental health disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. That is why there is a stigma. If they are diagnosed with cancer or heart disease, they do not think that they need psychological help.“Actually, they do need it. Their mental health is at risk and there is a very strong correlation between mental and physical health. If they are diagnosed with a chronic disease, they are likely to think about their situation, the possibility of losing their jobs, who will take care of their children or how their life is going to change.“Even if they are aware that they need psychological help, they are reluctant to get it because it is very uncomfortable for them to go out, meet someone and talk about it. The younger generation is more comfortable doing it online because there is a safe distance.”Another factor that makes digital sessions better than face-to-face ones is their regularity, he says. Normally, if one were to see a psychologist at a private hospital to lose weight, for example, they would need to attend 16 to 24 sessions worth RM300 each over a span of six months. Because these sessions are so far apart, it is hard for one to make significant progress, he adds.Naluri, on the other hand, costs less than RM150 a month for unlimited coaching sessions. Its professional team also briefly checks in with users every single day.While psychologists are good at motivation issues, some users do need very specific health and wellness advice that psychologists cannot help with. Acknowledging this, Azran brought in a team of medical specialists such as cardiologists, oncologists, pediatricians, family medicine specialists, obstetricians and gynaecologists as well as general practitioners.The Naluri app, meanwhile, comes with features such as a food journal, allowing users to easily track their food intake. Users do not need to count calories as the company’s dietitians will rate their efforts and give them feedback.Another handy feature is the thought journal, on which users can log their thought patterns and behaviours. Naluri’s coaches will also help users better understand themselves and assist them in coming up with steps to prevent negative recurrences.As the digital therapeutics concept is still new in Malaysia, it will take time before Naluri sees a significant take-up, says Azran. “It is like trying to sell retirement planning to Malaysians. It is really hard because they prefer to spend now and think later. That is why about 80% of Malaysians do not have enough to retire. It is like an uphill battle.”That is why the company works closely with insurers and corporate employers — two groups that are very concerned about the rising cost of chronic diseases. For insurers, offering Naluri’s service to its policyholders who have been diagnosed with a chronic disease is a risk mitigation measure. Those intending to purchase insurance who are deemed to be of higher risk could get the opportunity to enjoy lower premiums.“Actually, a lot of people today are rejected for insurance because by the time they want insurance, they are already overweight, hypertensive and their blood sugar is through the roof. What our insurance partners can do is go through the rejected customers and inform them that it will insure them and give them Naluri,” says Azran.“If they use Naluri and get healthier, the insurer will provide them with rebates. The healthier they are, the lower their premiums.” Betting on peopleApart from running Naluri, Azran Osman-Rani is an investor and adviser to a number of technology companies and start-ups, including video-on-demand service iflix (where he was previously its Malaysian CEO and group chief operating officer), financial technology (fintech) remittance company MoneyMatch, cognitive behavioural science firm Cognifyx and shipping and logistics player Yellow Porter.However, Azran says he is not a portfolio investor and he does not actively look for deals. Instead, he looks for the perfect team to bet on.“Start-ups are inherently risky. So normally, early-stage venture capitalists would take the portfolio approach. They would invest in more than 30 companies in the hope that two or three will give a good return on investment,” he says.“That is not how I do it. I do not invest in the business, I invest in founders. I only invest in founders I know well because I know their business plan will change in 6 to 12 months’ time. It is not about the merits of the business, it is about whether I believe these people have the ability to learn, pivot, adapt and grow. That is why I must know them personally.”Thus, Azran rejects a lot of investment and advisory requests he gets on sites such as LinkedIn. No matter how good a business idea sounds, he will not take the risk of investing in the company if he does not know the founders personally.For example, Azran met the founders of MoneyMatch when they first came up with the idea for the business. He mentored the team through WatchTower and Friends — the company’s first accelerator. He spent two years mentoring the team and observing how its business model had evolved over the years.“MoneyMatch’s original idea is nothing like its current business, which is remittance. Back then, the idea was that people do not want to use credit cards overseas because credit card companies charge exorbitant foreign exchange rates. That is why Malaysians will line up for an hour at MidValley Megamall’s currency exchange counters,” says Azran.“Initially, MoneyMatch wanted to match people who wanted to sell their excess foreign currency with people who wanted to buy it at a rate better than those offered by money changers. Today, its primary business is low-cost cross-border payments.”The same goes for Yellow Porter, he adds. Azran had worked with the company’s founder Vimal Kumar at both AirAsia X and iflix. That is the reason he believed the start-up would have a high chance of succeeding.“To me, the relationships matter a lot more than what the investment vehicle is. Also, I think it is best for people to invest in something they know well and have a passion for because they have to prepare for the downside of the investment,” says Azran.“If they are only investing for the money, they will get very stressed out when things go down.

Its passenger load factor stood at 88% in 1Q19, up one percentage point (ppt) from 1Q18.AirAsia said its capacity expansion, as measured by available seat kilometres (ASK), grew 11% y-o-y as the carrier added new routes and frequencies for both domestic and international routes to further grow its market share.Westports Holdings Bhd's net profit rose 13% to RM139.9 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019, from RM123.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. The higher net profit was attributed to a container tariff hike, effective from March 1, 2019.Earnings per share rose to 4.1 sen versus 3.63 sen previously.Quarterly revenue rose 7.8% to RM415.19 million from RM385.09 million a year ago, mainly attributed to double-digit growth in container volume and the implementation of container tariff hike since March 1.Seacera Group Bhd has been classified as a Practice Note 17 (PN17) company as it has defaulted on the payment of principal and profits to AmBank Islamic Bhd and not being able to provide a solvency declaration to Bursa Malaysia Securities.Seacera said it is looking into formulating a regularisation plan to address its PN17 status and will make the necessary announcement on the regularisation plan in due course.Seacera is now required to submit its regularisation plan to the Securities Commission Malaysia or Bursa Malaysia within the next 12 months, depending on whether the plan would significantly change its business direction.Maxis Bhd's new growth strategy gained momentum and drove its net profit 56% higher quarter-on-quarter to RM409 million on the back of revenue of RM2.23 billion.In its last quarter, Maxis said it had made significant changes to its long-term strategy, setting the foundation to be a strong converged solutions player in Malaysia.However, on a year-on-year basis, Maxis' net profit fell 22% to RM409 million or 5.2 sen per share for first quarter ended March 31, 2019 (1QFY19) from RM523 million or 6.7 sen per share, as the group suffered lower average revenue per user (Arpu) and termination of network sharing agreement.It said revenue was flat at RM2.23 billion for the quarter under review, compared with RM2.24 billion in the previous corresponding quarter.Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Bhd posted a higher net loss of RM29.37 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2019 versus a net loss of RM25.27 million a year earlier, as work order materialisation has been slower than expected especially in the offshore-fabrication segment.The group said despite crude oil price stability, project sanctions and materialisation of work orders are slower than expected, hence affecting orderbook replenishment.Revenue was, however, higher at RM203.11 million versus RM188.28 million previously.LFE Corp Bhd has bagged two contracts worth RM50.2 million for sub-contract works in Johor.LFE said its wholly-owned subsidiary LFE Engineering Sdn Bhd has won an RM35 million contract from Innoseven Sdn Bhd to supply labour, equipment, tools, plant and machineries for the completion of an extension to a hospital in Segamat for 24 months.Separately, LFE Engineering has accepted an award from Seri Jaya Perkasa Sdn Bhd for an RM15.2 million job to supply the same for the construction of a new boarding school comprising 25 classrooms, a dining hall and a multi-purpose hall for Sekolah Menengah Sains Segamat.Gadang Holdings Bhd has purchased 20 million shares in DWL Resources Bhd for RM18 million in cash or 90 sen per share, in a bid to build and strengthen the business relationship between both companies.Gadang said the acquisition of the shares, which represented a 10.07% stake in DWL Resources, was done via a direct business transaction.Gadang's unit Gadang Engineering (M) Sdn Bhd had on April 18 entered into a pre-bid consortium agreement with Million Rich Development Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DWL, to work with each other to bid for infrastructure projects.They will jointly undertake a contract for such infrastructure works if their bids are successful.As promised to shareholders earlier, Kumpulan Perangsang Selangor Bhd has declared a special one-off dividend of 32.6 sen per share, following its divestment of its 30%-stake in Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor Sdn Bhd (Splash).KPS said the dividend, totalling RM175.19 million, will be paid on May 28. The ex-date is May 13.The special dividend is in addition to the group's final dividend of 4.25 sen per share.Can-One Bhd’s subsidiary Can-One International Sdn Bhd now holds a 95.88% stake in Kian Joo Can Factory Bhd, giving it enough control of the company to compulsorily acquire the rest of the shares and delist Kian Joo.Kian Joo said it was informed that as at today, based on the valid acceptances, Can-One International holds 425.88 million shares or a 95.88% stake in Kian Joo.In addition, Can-One International has received valid acceptances of not less than nine-tenths in the value of Kian Joo shares (excluding the 34.52% stake already held by Can-One International).As such, Can-One International intends to invoke the provisions of Section 222(1) of the  Capital Market and Services Act, to compulsorily acquire the rest of Kian Joo shares for which acceptances have not been received.ManagePay Systems Bhd has entered into a joint venture and licensing agreement with MyTV Broadcasting Sdn Bhd to market and supply Hybrid Broadband Broadcasting Television (HbbTV) set top boxes, manage eCommerce on the HbbTV platform and ePayment solution services.ManagePay said it has also entered into an agreement with CoShip Technology to undertake the design, assembly, completion, supply and delivery of the set top boxes.The agreement with CoShip also includes the provision and performance of the warranty services, support and maintenance services and all necessary and incidental works and services so that the set top boxes are able to connect, interoperate, integrate or interface with the MYTV System.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/airasia-westports-seacera-maxis-mmhe-lfe-gadang-dwl-resources-kumpulan-perangsang-selangor

"April 19, 2019 14:48 pm +08",AIRASIA,"Two grounded airlines in a decade cast doubt on India boom","MUMBAI (April 19): Jet Airways India Ltd, the second local carrier to ground its entire fleet in the past decade, is casting a shadow on India’s booming aviation sector.Once the nation’s biggest airline by market value, Jet Airways’ shares nosedived by a record 31% on Thursday in Mumbai after saying it would suspend operations on a “temporary” basis as it ran out of money. A severe cash crunch had pushed Vijay Mallya’s indebted Kingfisher Airlines Ltd to ground its planes in 2012. It never flew again and Mallya is still fighting his extradition to India from London.India’s aviation sector is an investment conundrum: it’s the world’s fastest-growing aviation market that has seen 54 consecutive months of double-digit percentage passenger growth and yet it’s notoriously difficult to make money in. As Jet Airways’ lenders race to find an investor for the debt-ravaged airline, suitors will weigh the sector’s prospects against India’s high jet-fuel prices and a crushing fare war worsened by the entry of no-frills carriers.“It’s a terrible setback for the entire industry. This makes the whole aviation story look doubtful,” said Parvez Damania, a Mumbai-based aviation expert. “Grounding of Jet Airways has impacted the credibility of double-digit growth of Indian civil aviation.”The crisis at Jet Airways that risks 23,000 jobs, has come at an exceptionally sensitive time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who’s seeking re-election in ongoing national elections, amid concerns on rising unemployment. The Modi administration has in the past few years cracked down hard on India’s delinquent borrowers to repair the books of banks that currently have the world’s worst soured loan ratio.“Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going,” the carrier said in an April 17 statement. “With immediate effect, Jet Airways is compelled to cancel all its international and domestic flights.”The carrier added that the decision was taken after a painstaking evaluation of all alternatives, with the ministries of civil aviation and finance and the aviation safety regulator informed in advance. It’ll continue to support a bid process initiated by lenders and that it aims to return to flying “as soon as possible.” That mechanism is due to conclude on May 10.‘Reasonably Hopeful’State Bank of India, on behalf of all Jet’s lenders, said in a Thursday statement that they had decided that “the best way forward for the survival of the carrier is to get the binding bids from potential investors” who were interested. Lenders are “reasonably hopeful” that the bid process is likely to be successful in determining a fair value for the carrier, it said.Lenders have asked the government to protect Jet’s prime airport slots to prevent an erosion of its value, Business Standard reported on Friday, citing sources it didn’t name.The banks are said to have shortlisted Etihad Airways PJSC, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, people familiar with the discussions said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.Potential investors in the beleaguered airline have asked lenders to take a haircut of as much as 80% on Jet’s debt, The Economic Times reported, citing unnamed sources.Jet’s financial problems are not new, according to Dharmesh Kant, head of retail research at Mumbai-based Indianivesh Securities Ltd. “It had been kicking the can down the road but sooner or later the time had to run out and it did,” he said over phone.Jet, which broke the monopoly of state-run Air India Ltd in the early 1990s, has been in decline since budget airlines started offering ultra-low fares that hurt profits and led it to pile up more than US$1 billion in debt. It also has unpaid dues to aircraft-leasing firms and employees including pilots, who have been agitating over non-payment of salaries.Jet’s founder Naresh Goyal resigned as chairman of the ailing airline last month, caving in to pressure from creditors. Goyal, who started in aviation as a ticketing agent, rose to be among the nation’s elite after Jet became India’s premier full service carrier.It won’t be an easy task for Jet’s new owner to turnaround the airline, which has reported losses for four straight quarters and in nine out of 11 last financial years. Grounding the airline means its value is going to erode further, making the revival tougher for any suitor.“With no aircraft, pilots, flight attendants and engineers, I certainly don’t see how any bidder will continue to see value in Jet Airways,” said Mark D Martin, founder of Martin Consulting. “History and our business dynamics prove that once an airline shuts down in India, it doesn’t restart.”Dirt-Cheap FaresIndian carriers, including Jet, have seen their profits hurt by the world’s highest jet-fuel taxes and a price war worsened by the entry of low-cost, no-frills airlines such as IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd that offered dirt-cheap fares with lower overheads.Foreign carriers from Malaysia’s low-cost AirAsia Group Bhd to Singapore Airlines Ltd and Jet’s minority shareholder Etihad, have all learnt how hard it is to make money in Indian skies.Air India, the state carrier, has been propped up on bailouts from the exchequer for years. AirAsia, which entered in 2014 with a vow to break even in four months, is still nowhere close to its goal. Vistara, Singapore Air’s joint venture with the Tata Group that started in 2015, has yet to make any money. SpiceJet had almost collapsed in 2014.The only exception in the sector is Indigo, run by Interglobe Aviation Ltd, which has reported annual profits since 2011 and whose stock has soared 33% this year. Spicejet, which has been on the mend, has also advanced as it leases more aircraft and starts more flights on the New Delhi-Mumbai route.Air fares are expected to rise in the coming weeks, possibly denting the passenger growth story that was making India the world’s quickest-growing aviation market. Jet’s decision to stop flying will also push the fares higher.Jet’s lenders could have done a bit more to keep the carrier up in the air, if only to preserve the value of the asset they have put on the block, according to Martin. “To think that no money was pumped in to resolve liabilities of lessors, fuelers and salaries is unforgiving,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/two-grounded-airlines-decade-cast-doubt-india-boom
"April 19, 2019 11:17 am +08",AIRASIA,"Cancellation of JV low-cost carrier in Vietnam unlikely to impact AirAsia Group expansion plan","AirAsia Group Bhd
(April 18, RM2.43)
Maintain buy with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM3.40: AirAsia Group Bhd’s (AAGB) wholly-owned subsidiary AirAsia Investment Ltd together with Gumin Company Ltd and Hai Au Aviation Joint Stock Company have decided to terminate and release each other from all obligations under the transaction agreements of the proposed joint venture (JV) with effect from Wednesday. According to the initial plan, the formerly proposed new low-cost carrier in Vietnam was set to be launched in the third quarter of financial year 2019 (3QFY19).While the cancellation of the JV may appear to negatively impact AAGB’s expansion plan, we do not think that this is the case. In early April, AAGB introduced Can Tho to its network of routes with a weekly frequency of four flights. In fact, this is the first-ever international flight to Can Tho, indicating AAGB’s lead as an international airline for that destination. Can Tho is AAGB’s sixth destination in Vietnam, while new services between Bangkok and Can Tho are set to be commenced in May. With 8.5 million visitors visiting the Mekong Delta in 2018, we opine that this destination has the potential to attract more visitors which will positively flow into AAGB’s load factor. Therefore, it is not imperative for AAGB to set up a JV carrier in Vietnam.We maintain our FY19 and FY20 earnings estimates for AAGB as we did not impute any impact from the formerly proposed JV into our estimates. Moreover, AAGB did not make any financial commitments to the JV which would have cost RM58.2 million, representing a 30% stake in Hai Au Aviation Joint Stock Company.We maintain “buy” with an unchanged TP of RM3.40 per share, pegging its FY19 forecast earnings per share at a price-earnings ratio (PER) of 10 times. It is notable that AAGB is trailing at a PER of 4.1 times, while its Asian peers are approximately trading at a PER above 10 times which we opine is unwarranted given the group’s position as the leading Asean low-cost carrier. Based on our previous analysis of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (buy; TP: RM8.90) in our report on Monday, we opine that the proposed international departure levy will not have much impact on passenger growth. — MIDF Research, April 18",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cancellation-jv-lowcost-carrier-vietnam-unlikely-impact-airasia-group-expansion-plan

"April 17, 2019 16:00 pm +08",AIRASIA,"K-One looking to the cloud for a pot of gold ","AFTER a turnaround last year, ACE Market-listed box-build manufacturer K-One Technology Bhd is banking on its newly-acquired cloud computing business to shore up its financial performance.According to K-One executive chairman and co-founder Edwin Lim Beng Fook, the global window of opportunity for cloud computing services may be closing within the next three years, but there is still immense opportunity in Southeast Asia.As such, it is important for G-AsiaPacific Sdn Bhd — the cloud computing arm of K-One — to establish itself and gain a foothold in the Asean market, which is a laggard in the sector compared with the US, Europe, Japan, South Korea and China, he tells The Edge in an interview. “Although G-AsiaPacific is already the market leader in Malaysia, our next target is to venture abroad. We have to grab as much low-hanging fruit as we can within a short period of time.”Starting this year, G-AsiaPacific will venture into Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, followed by Singapore in its second phase of expansion. Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia could come after.“We have to spread our arms all over the Asean region. We want to give our potential competitors a run for their money. This game is about who gets there first to garner the market share,” says Lim, 61, who co-founded K-One in 2001.Last month, K-One completed the acquisition of a 60% stake in G-AsiaPacific for RM20.4 million cash. As a whole, the company is valued at RM34 million, representing eight times its annual profit guarantee of RM4.25 million.G-AsiaPacific is a fully integrated cloud advisory and brokerage firm founded by three technopreneurs — Goh Kiang Kiat, Goh Kiang Kian and Chen Kak Toong — in 2008.Lim acknowledges the trio could still grow G-AsiaPacific on their own but, by combining forces, K-One could take the company to the next level within a shorter time.“They were introduced to me by friends almost a year ago. I came to learn that they have done pretty well over the last 10 years, growing from a smallish firm to a medium-sized tech company today. They hope to take the company to greater heights, so we decided to do this.”Interestingly, K-One intends to acquire the remaining 40% of AsiaPacific as early as the second or third quarter of next year, through the issuance of K-One shares to the three founders.In the financial year ended Feb 28, 2018 (FY2018), G-AsiaPacific generated a profit of about RM4 million on revenue of RM17.5 million. Lim says the company has been profitable all along, but has only grown to a respectable size in recent years.“Today, everybody is jumping into the cloud computing space, including Alibaba and Tencent. Then there are Apple and IBM. Some of these companies are expecting cloud services to make the most money for them in the coming years. It is a very important space,” he says. Three main principalsAt the moment, G-AsiaPacific has three principals — Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft. When the time is right, the company aims to take on additional principals.“We are always exploring, we never close our doors. We might secure one or two new principals in the next two years,” says Lim.For perspective, G-AsiaPacific is a distributor for Amazon, Google and Microsoft. The company does not own any physical data and data centres. It helps the clients of the principals manage and migrate their data to the cloud, hosted by Amazon, Google and Microsoft, which own the data centres.“Most of the time, companies have their own in-house servers and back-up servers. But as they grow bigger, rather than storing the data in their own servers, they might as well put it up on the cloud,” says Lim.As for the principals, he says that their capital expenditure and working capital should reduce as they do not have to hire so many employees around the world. “Their preferred business model is to work with partners like us. We hire the technical staff, who will be trained by the principals, and our people do the migration and maintenance on their behalf. We even knock on doors and sign up clients for them.”Currently, G-AsiaPacific has over 3,000 customers in Malaysia, including AirAsia Bhd, Gamuda Land, IJM Corp, Malindo Air, Padini, Royal Selangor, Starbucks and Shiseido.“I believe Malaysians have started to realise the benefits of technology and the cloud, how it can help them to save costs,” says Lim.Following two consecutive years of losses, K-One returned to the black in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018), with a net profit of RM5.6 million on revenue of RM73 million.With G-AsiaPacific’s profit guarantee, Lim expects K-One, which has a market capitalisation of RM174.9 million,  to register strong double-digit revenue and profit growth for the next two years at the very least. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/kone-looking-cloud-pot-gold

MyCC then filed for judicial review to quash CAT’s decision.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysia-airlines-airasias-appeal-against-rm10m-fine-be-heard-dec-13

The monies recovered will be applied in accordance with section 201(7) of the CMSA, according to the posting the SC has put up on the website.The other three individuals found having taken advantage of insider information for trading purposes are former head of equity research at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd Terence Wong @ Huang Thar-Rearn, Abdul Radzim Abdul Rahman, who is the independent director of Amanah Investment, and Mohamed Radzif Mohamed Shamsudin.Wong also entered into a settlement with the SC amounting to RM573,150 for the same offence. He was noted to have acquired 800,000 MAS shares in July 2011. According to Reuters, CIMB was the adviser for the share swap deal.If not for the settlements, the SC would likely to have brought the matter to court for civil suits.    The insider trading is believed to have been linked to the proposed share swap deal that was unveiled in August 2011. MAS share price was on a roaster coaster ride then and its share price soared by as much as 28% in the days following the news. But the rally was short lived and the price then drifted lower.  To recap, in 2011, shareholders of MAS, AirAsia and AirAsia X Sdn Bhd (AAX) had proposed to enter into a share swap deal, originally intended to lend a helping hand to the loss-making national carrier.The agreement involved Khazanah Nasional Bhd (controlling shareholder of MAS) and Tune Air Sdn Bhd entering into a share swap agreement so that there will be cross-holding of shares resulting in Tune Air obtaining a 20.5% stake in then-listed MAS and Khazanah obtaining 10% in AirAsia.Kamarudin and Tan Sri Tony Fernandes are the owners of Tune Air.Both airlines also entered into a comprehensive collaboration framework. It was agreed that MAS was to be a full-service premium carrier, while AirAsia and AAX would be regional low-cost and medium-to-long haul low-cost carriers respectively.This was done in order to synergise the two Malaysian-based airlines and reduce competition against the national carrier.However, due to public outcry, the share swap deal was aborted eight months later.

(April 1, 35 sen)
Maintain neutral with a revised target price (TP) of 34 sen (previously 33 sen). GD Express Carrier Bhd’s (GDEX) inked a strategic partnership with RedCargo Logistics Sdn Bhd (RedCargo), the cargo and logistics arm of AirAsia Group Bhd (AAGB) which begins on April 1, 2019. GDEX is not the first to form a partnership with RedCargo as Tasco Bhd was appointed the first direct logistics partner of RedCargo in January this year.The partnership enables GDEX to provide its customers with greater access by utilising AAGB’s network whereby goods can be transported efficiently on more than 5,000 weekly flights across the Asia-Pacific. GDEX in return would provide RedCargo with its last-mile services.With two logistics companies in partnership with RedCargo, we view that there is ample network capacity available to be booked by logistics partners. This bodes well for the growth in international parcel traffic which has been growing for the past three years. Apart from that, we do not discount the possibility of special rates being offered by AAGB to GDEX to attract more volume being channelled to the belly space of AAGB’s aircrafts. This in turn would incentivise GDEX to expand its services.RedCargo was incorporated in March last year as the exclusive provider of cargo capacity for AAGB. Therefore, we opine that the impact on GDEX earnings to be minimal at this juncture as it has yet to undergo its gestation period. As such we maintain our earnings estimates for financial years 2019 (FY19) and 2020 (FY20).The change in GDEX’s TP follows the higher revised terminal growth rate of 3% in our two-stage discounted cash flow model which reflects the growth in the Southeast Asian e-commerce industry which is expected to be worth US$102 billion by 2025.GDEX’s healthy balance sheet has supported the group’s various expansion plans. This includes acquisition of a 44.5% stake in SAP Express, an Indonesian courier company and ongoing effort to secure a partnership in Vietnam by the end of calendar year 2019  (CY2019) facilitated by Webbytes through its cloud-based point-of-sale platform. Nonetheless, we view that the earnings accretion from these ventures is yet to be meaningful given it is still in a gestation period. Meanwhile, valuation remains stretched at this juncture as compared to the average industry price-earnings ratio (PER) of about 15 times. All factors considered, we are maintaining our “neutral” stance at this juncture. In the long term, rerating catalysts for GDEX would be: (i) slowdown in growth for last-mile delivery start-up companies and (ii) stronger consumer-to-consumer business demand. — MIDF Research, April 1",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/redcargo-tieup-seen-incentivise-gdex-expand
"April 02, 2019 11:00 am +08",AIRASIA,"One agency to enforce traffic laws","KUALA LUMPUR: The government is conducting a study on streamlining the enforcement of traffic laws across multiple agencies, said Transport Minister Anthony Loke. “We are heading in that direction. A study is being undertaken. We hope this can be implemented,” he told the Dewan Rakyat.Loke was responding to PAS deputy president Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man’s (PAS-Kubang Kerian) question on whether the government intends to streamline or combine all agencies involved in road-related laws into one to reduce overlaps.“We agree. If possible, the enforcement should be streamlined, so it is not disorderly. The public is sometimes unaware about which agency is undertaking the enforcement,” said Loke.Road laws are enforced by multiple federal agencies working separately on issues. For example, traffic laws come under the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM), vehicle modifications under the Road Transport Department and vehicle exhaust quality under the Department of Environment.Some overlaps are seen in traffic laws — for example, the PDRM and local councils issuing summons for traffic obstructions such as improper parking.On another matter, the Land Public Transport Agency (Apad) will be meeting e-hailing companies this week, said Loke, to iron out details on the operating licences for their drivers.“We have been in touch with [many] e-hailing companies. Most of [their drivers] have applied for the Public Service Vehicle (PSV) licence, and some of them got their approval,” said Loke.“A meeting between the Apad and e-hailing companies will be held this week,” he told reporters outside Dewan Rakyat yesterday.At end-2018, it was reported that all e-hailing drivers can undergo the PSV course beginning yesterday and obtain their licences — similar with the requirement for existing taxi drivers.The PSV licence is compulsory for all e-hailing drivers beginning July this year. It has been reported that the PSV training modules take six hours to complete, at a fee capped at RM200.In September last year, Loke said Malaysia has about 200,000 e-hailing drivers, three-quarters of whom are part-time drivers — compared with 60,000 registered taxi drivers nationwide.On a different matter, Loke said no airline has proposed to the ministry to develop airports in the country. “There is no airline applying to develop airports. As far as we are concerned, there is separation between airport operators and airlines.”Kedah is slated to welcome a second international airport in Kulim. The state already has an international airport on Langkawi island.Together with the Penang International Airport in Bayan Lepas, there are three international airports in the northern corridor if Kulim’s airport — reportedly to be a privately funded initiative — kicks off.On July 19 last year, it was reported that AirAsia Group Bhd and Airbus SE are in discussions to develop an industrial aeronautical centre in Malaysia, which industry experts speculate may include a low-cost carrier terminal.According to AirAsia, a feasibility study comprising three sections would be carried out over 18 months.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/one-agency-enforce-traffic-laws

He recalled his early days at Malaysia Airlines when the national carrier would play its part to promote the event by painting “Visit Malaysia Year” on the sides of its planes. That hasn’t happened yet. Perhaps we can do more now that we have AirAsia and Malindo Air as well, apart from Malaysia Airlines.Come to think of it, I have not noticed any commercial on radio or TV, or any billboard promoting VMY 2020, as I travel to and from work.No VMY 2020 ads popping up either when I watch YouTube or my favourite Korean drama on the net. No song telling me that to know Malaysia is to love Malaysia or why Malaysia is truly Asia — or its equivalent — has been heard over the airwaves.In fact, determining when the tourism ministry will start its VMY 2020 campaign is almost as difficult as guessing when Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber plan to hold a wedding ceremony for their family and friends.The clock is ticking, but the ministry has yet to reveal the full line-up of events.In fact, the last time there was a lot of publicity about VMY 2020 was in January last year when the logo featuring the two mascots — an orangutan and a proboscis monkey wearing sunglasses and grinning — came under fire from netizens because of the amateurish design. Then, fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on who you talk to), we got caught up in the 14th general election, which saw a change of government. We also got a new tourism minister in July. These distractions gave Wira the orangutan and the proboscis monkey a reprieve until recently, when a contest to redesign the logo was held. It will take another month before a winner is announced.VMY used to be something that people from the local travel trade would look forward to. The promotions would begin a year earlier with a series of year-long special events and activities. The celebrations would culminate with the Independence Day parade on Aug 31. The success of the first VMY in 1990 spurred another in 1994, and in 2007. The last time VMY was held was 2014. In fact, some of our regional rivals had become worried over our aggressive promotion of tourism.Indeed, the ministry’s efforts have helped push tourism from being the country’s fifth largest foreign-exchange earner in 1990 to second largest today, after manufacturing. The number of foreign visitors reached 25.3 million last year from 7.4 million in 1990. Spending by tourists amounted to RM84.1 billion last year from RM4.5 billion in 1990.Perhaps Malaysia should consider taking a leaf out of South Korea’s book. The East Asian country has done a great job boosting its tourism through its music, TV dramas and films. The seven-member Korean boy band BTS is, to date, the most successful manifestation of the Korean wave. Hyundai Research Institute estimates that the band contributes US$3.6 billion to the South Korean economy annually. That works out to roughly 17% of our tourism receipts.Perhaps the ministry has a lot of promotional activities up its sleeve and is just waiting for the right moment to build up the momentum towards VMY 2020. Until then, I have my Korean dramas to keep me entertained.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/coffee-break-remember-visit-malaysia-year-yes-its-back-next-year

"March 29, 2019 14:00 pm +08",AIRASIA,"Special Report: Saving Malaysia Airlines, again","SHOULD the government choose to shut it down, Malaysia Airlines Bhd will go down as the first national airline in Asia to go bust (Japan Airlines emerged from bankruptcy after two years), joining the ranks of its European counterparts such as Sabena, Air Berlin, Alitalia and Cyprus Airways.The flag carrier, which saw Khazanah Nasional Bhd pay RM1.38 billion to take it private in August 2014 and reboot it into a smaller airline under its current name in September 2015, is once again facing an uncertain future after Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad remarked last week that shutting it down was one option being considered by the government. Selling the national asset and refinancing its debts are two other possibilities the government will explore, he said.The prime minister’s warning comes as calls for the beleaguered airline to be wound down intensified in the past few weeks. The airline’s woes flared up on March 5 after its sole shareholder Khazanah reported its first annual loss in over a decade, mainly due to a RM3.7 billion writedown of Malaysia Airlines’ value last year.It doesn’t help matters that the airline missed its target to return to the black last year and, according to Centre for Aviation (CAPA) chief analyst and chief representative for Southeast Asia Brendan Sobie, will find it difficult to achieve profitability, at least in the near future, given current market conditions.On March 1, the private company revealed that it finished 2018 with a marginally lower loss compared to a year ago but it did not disclose the figures.Filings with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) show that Malaysia Airlines’ net loss increased by 85% year on year to RM812.11 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY2017). It has lost RM2.35 billion between 2015 and 2017.While it did not disclose its exact revenue for FY2018 except to say that it grew by 1% y-o-y, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that revenue rose to RM8.76 billion from RM8.67 billion in FY2017. It has yet to file its financial statements for FY2018 with SSM.Malaysia Airlines blamed FY2018’s poor performance on crew shortage, intense competition, oversupply of capacity and volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange.It is worth noting that when the 12-point MAS Recovery Plan (MRP) was conceived in 2014, fuel price was US$75.68 per barrel. As at March 8, 2019, the International Air Transport Association jet fuel price monitor was up 3.5% at US$80.30 per barrel from a year ago.The ringgit had also weakened by 3.6% to 4.9% to 4.0910 against the US dollar last Thursday. Khazanah’s assumption under the five-year recovery plan was that the local currency would range from 3.90 to 3.95.Still, critics point to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, which turned things around with a HK$2.3 billion profit last year after three years of heavy losses and Singapore Airlines (SIA), which managed to turn in a net profit of S$284 million for the third financial quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, amid the challenging operating environment. Khazanah seen more willing to give up the flag carrierAfter not one but four failed attempts at restructuring the national carrier and setting it on a path to sustainable profitability, including during the 42 years when it was known as Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), the calls are growing louder for the government to shut it down for good.Its weak financial health — even after a RM6 billion injection from Khazanah in 2014 — also makes it a prime target when Malaysia’s new government is looking to trim its huge debt of RM1.087 trillion as at Dec 31, 2018.Indeed, some analysts say the timing of Khazanah’s RM3.7 billion impairment charge on Malaysia Airlines in 2018 is an indication that it may be ready to end or sell its loss-making unit.HLIB Research aviation analyst Daniel Wong notes that Malaysia Airlines is not part of Khazanah’s core portfolio, suggesting that the state investment firm would be willing to part with its airline business if the investment does not make financial sense and assuming government approval is granted.“While we do not doubt Malaysia Airlines is a pride to Malaysia as the national carrier has been around since 1947, we remain doubtful of Khazanah’s willingness and ability to sustain the continued losses of Malaysia Airlines. The losses of Malaysia Airlines may amount to RM1 billion per year,” he says in a March 13 report. Malaysia Airlines can still fly highOnce-troubled flag carriers such as British Airways (BA), Japan Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Qantas Airways are living proof that Malaysia Airlines still has a chance of turning around, says a senior aviation consultant who declined to be named.A multitude of factors have contributed to Malaysia Airlines’ financial woes, but foremost among them is the lack of autonomy to run the business without government intervention, say airline experts and analysts.“There are no obvious or easy solutions and there are so many external factors that will impact Malaysia Airlines’ future financials. However, there are areas for potential improvement,” CAPA’s Sobie tells The Edge.“While the latest restructuring went much deeper than previous attempts, it didn’t go deep enough and address all the legacy issues. The airline could potentially take another crack at reducing its costs but this can only be effective if there is no political interference.“It could also relook its commercial and network strategy. Evolving into more of a regional airline could be an option,” he says.Sobie points out that while shutting down the airline is obviously politically difficult and has never really been an option, it now seems that it is being seriously considered.“There would still be sufficient competition in the market (even with Malaysia Airlines gone) and the void would likely be filled by the existing or new competitors. Keep in mind there were only two (Malaysia-based) players (Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia Group Bhd) before Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd was launched five years ago. However, another restructuring would still likely be the preferred option politically,” he adds.Transport infrastructure consultancy Modalis Infrastructure Partners associate director Khair Mirza believes Malaysia Airlines can thrive given a level playing field.“By definition, GLCs (government-linked companies) need to play a dual role. So, as long as it has a level playing field against other carriers, it can succeed, like how Qantas, Turkish Airlines and Garuda have all succeeded,” he adds.Khair points out that Malaysia Airlines is the only recognised strategic GLC that faces unfettered competition while trying to balance a social equity role. “It’s like asking an elephant to climb up a coconut tree just because the monkey has glorified climbing trees.”Meanwhile, a senior aviation consultant notes that the government must also ensure that Malaysia Airlines has the right people on its board of directors to steer the airline.“The board has had many of the same members for several years despite losses. It is good to have new people with fresh ideas to help move Malaysia Airlines forward.“It is also good to have a combination of some with overall airline industry experience (at least two to three years) and some good professionals in finance and law,” he adds.The consultant also points out that the airline must have the right people in senior management. “Malaysia Airlines CEO Izham Ismail should be given a chance to carry on and he deserves the freedom to name his own team,” he says.Modalis’ Khair concurs, noting that a shake-up of the eight-member board is long overdue.He also believes that it is time to allow Malaysia Airlines to award contracts based on competitive bidding rather than “giving contracts to non-strategic investees that have bloated into public-listed entities, squeezing out bona fide market participants”. A case in point is the RM42.99 million three-year contract bagged by UEM Edgenta Bhd’s 80%-owned subsidiary KFM Holdings Bhd in June 2016 to provide facility management services to Malaysia Airlines via direct negotiation.A check on Malaysia Airlines website reveals that its board comprises one executive director —  Izham — and seven non-executive directors, namely Tan Sri Krishnan Tan Boon Seng, Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, David Lau Nai Pek, Dr Mohamadon Abdullah, Sheranjiv M Sammanthan, Mohammad Izani Ashari and Ahmad Zulqarnain Che Onn. Foo Shiou Voon is an alternative director for Mohammad Izani.Tan, Lau, Mohamadon and Mohammad Izani have been on the board since August 2015. Tan, Lau and Mohamadon were also directors at the old MAS.An accountant by training, Tan is currently non-executive deputy chairman of IJM Corp Bhd. Zamzamzairani served as the group CEO and managing director of Telekom Malaysia Bhd from April 2008 to April 2017, while Lau has over 35 years of experience in finance and is also a director of Axiata Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd. Mohamadon had served MAS for 32 years before retiring on Dec 31, 2004, as senior general manager of corporate services.Meanwhile, four board members — Sheranjiv, Mohammad Izani, Ahmad Zulqarnain and Foo — are Khazanah appointees. Asset sales may offer some reliefHLIB Research’s Wong believes it will be wise for the government to divest Malaysia Airlines or find a strategic partner instead of shutting it down, which will stem the draining of government cash while reducing staff layoff, as the takeover entity will still need a workforce to run the airline.Malaysia Airlines has undergone two rounds of layoffs in the last 13 years. It shed over 6,000 employees in 2006 and 2007 under the Business Turnaround Plan 1 and another 6,000 in 2015 under the MRP. Today. it has a 13,000-strong workforce, which some still consider bloated given its smaller network.A former Malaysia Airlines senior executive says the government should take a leaf from the sale of a 49.9% stake in national carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd to Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.“There won’t be any government interference in the management of the business then.“The entire board and key personnel of Malaysia Airlines must also be replaced. They had the opportunity to revive the airline, but failed. Let others in the private sector (preferably Malaysian) to fix this. It can be done,” he says.“The problems in Malaysia Airlines are obvious; we need the ‘will’ to do it. The government needs to let go of the national airline and let the private sector run it entirely, just like BA and Iberia,” he adds.He is also of the view that Malaysia Airlines’ business units like cargo, engineering, flight catering, ground handling and the loyalty programme should be transformed from cost centres to profit centres where they are responsible for their own revenues, costs and resulting profits.“These units should be looked at as standalone businesses. They  can then grow and expand without being held back by the passenger business.”Malaysia Airlines’ FY2017 financial statements show that its cargo revenue stood at just RM551.27 million, a far cry from the RM1.66 billion reported in FY2013.Its engineering services business has also been scaled down from a world-renowned player in the maintenance, repair and overhaul market under MAS Aerospace Engineering to a purely self-supporting unit today. Airport handling and engineering services revenue stood at RM49.34 million in FY2017 compared with RM256.86 million in FY2013. Note:Following the publication of this story, UEM Edgenta Bhd has clarified that Malaysia Airlines Bhd had conducted an open tender process for the RM42.99 million three-year facility management services contract covering specific parts of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and its Kelana Jaya academy in Petaling Jaya, and not via direct negotiation as reported.The open tender process saw the participation of several facility management service providers including KFM Holdings Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of UEM Edgenta, UEM Edgenta said in a statement.It noted that Malaysia Airlines undertook a request for information in May 2015, followed by a request for proposal in July 2015 and commercial clarification.""In the final round, KFM along with two other facilities management service providers were shortlisted. KFM was informed of the contract award in February 2016 and it was completed in December 2018,"" it said.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/special-report-saving-malaysia-airlines-again

Nationwide, the group currently employs 4,000 people, and wants to raise the number to 5,200 in four years.He said Asia-Pacific is seeing a higher passenger traffic growth, which is expected to boost demand for aircraft production and MRO services.“We expect annual growth in passenger traffic of 5.5% a year in Asia-Pacific, compared with 4.4% worldwide. Asia-Pacific is growing faster than the rest of the world, hence why we’re seeing a growth,” said Nasr, adding the trend is expected to continue for 20 years.This is why the group remains “100% committed to growing our presence in Malaysia, firmly believing the country’s aerospace industry’s potential to become one of the largest in the region”, according to Nasr.Airbus Malaysia country head Raymond Lim, also the chief executive officer of Airbus’ wholly-owned MRO outfit — Sepang Aircraft Engineering Sdn Bhd — said the region’s estimated need of about 20,000 aircraft in 20 years, versus its current 7,000 aircraft, would boost MRO operations and drive demand for more skilled workers.Lim also said the group is seeking to grow its helicopter MRO segment by conducting more complex MRO works via its helicopter unit here, Airbus Helicopters Malaysia Sdn Bhd. “We have made a significant investment in making Airbus Helicopters a complex repair centre for the region.”He cited the group’s new helicopter completion and delivery centre here is set to open in May, and that the group is looking to produce 20 helicopters a year from the centre.On the group’s order book, Airbus Asia Pacific head of communications Sean Lee said Airbus now has 727 aircraft orders in Malaysia, of which 278 planes have been delivered.Of the total, AirAsia has ordered 592 aircraft, AirAsia X (96) and Malaysia Airlines (39). Of these, 219 units have been delivered to AirAsia, 20 to AirAsia X, and all 39 to Malaysia Airlines.Malaysia is Airbus’ largest supply base in Southeast Asia, and the group’s fifth-largest supply base for composite parts globally, according to Nasr.

"March 26, 2019 08:53 am +08",AIRASIA,"MAHB share price beaten down as uncertainties loom","KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) became the selling target yesterday. Its share price plunged as much as 10.3% to an intraday low of RM6.90 but it managed to recoup some losses to close at a two-year low of RM7.33.Investment analysts were puzzled with the fierce selling given that most of them, who track the airport operator, are recommending the stock to clients.According to Bloomberg data, the counter has 14 “buy” calls, six “hold” calls, and one “sell” call, with consensus target price (TP) at RM9.33.Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng commented that investors could be overreacting to the news flow, which he cautioned that several uncertainties have cast a shadow on the airport operator.“There are some uncertainties surrounding MAHB, as the government is looking into new ways to operate airports in Malaysia, [and] there is also this RM400 million litigation between MAHB and AirAsia X Bhd,” said Ang.The news flow related to MAHB has been non-stop in recent months. It started off with the proposal in Budget 2019 on [the] setting up [of] an airport real estate investment trust, followed by Transport Minister Anthony Loke indicating that the government was mulling lowering the passenger service charge (PSC) to make air travel more affordable. The airport operator later got into a legal dispute with AirAsia X.The most recemt news is that the government has confirmed allowing a third party to build and operate a new airport in Kulim, Kedah. Such news is perceived by some quarters as a move to liberalise the airport management business, which is currently dominated by MAHB.Meanwhile, MAHB is in the midst of negotiating with the government for a regulatory asset base framework, which would outline a new ceiling price for the PSC that commensurates with the required capital expenditure by the airport operator in future.Yesterday, Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali stressed that the government can no longer afford to build airports even though there is a need for them. “With participation of the private sector, we need to have a new framework to regulate their participation in developing airports,” he said.However, Maybank Investment Bank aviation analyst Mohshin Aziz pointed out that MAHB’s share price has not moved much last week when the government announced that it would allow the private sector to build a new airport in Kulim.“It was strange ... many people have called to ask me about the sudden selldown,” said Mohshin when contacted but he added that there was no new selling impetus yesterday.MAHB share price has been dropping since August last year, down 25% from a high of RM9.80.

They have expressed their wish to the Government and some have written to me.""They can do research on the company (MAB),"" he said in an interview on TV3’s prime-time Buletin Utama tonight.Daim said the aviation sector is increasingly complex and complicated, and huge funds and expertise are extremely important to grow the business.Consequently, he said if part of MAB's interest is sold to a foreign company, it will get capital injections and expertise, indirectly restoring the company.“It is okay if others want to buy our stocks, if they want to bring in expertise, then bring it,"" he said.He said the Government should not interfere with the national carrier’s operations and it is enough to lend its support it by helping to secure landing rights at strategic locations.Daim, however, does not see the need to review the proposed merger of Malaysia Airlines and Airasia as previously mentioned.“Malaysia Airlines is a premium airline, while AirAsia is a low-cost carrier.

"March 22, 2019 18:07 pm +08",AIRASIA,"Why does Malaysia Airlines keep failing — and is there a way to stop it?","SHOULD the government choose to shut it down, Malaysia Airlines Bhd will go down as the first national airline in Asia to go bust (Japan Airlines emerged from bankruptcy after two years), joining the ranks of its European counterparts such as Sabena, Air Berlin, Alitalia and Cyprus Airways.The flag carrier, which saw Khazanah Nasional Bhd pay RM1.38 billion to take it private in August 2014 and reboot it into a smaller airline under its current name in September 2015, is once again facing an uncertain future after Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad remarked last week that shutting it down was one option being considered by the government. Selling the national asset and refinancing its debts are two other possibilities the government will explore, he said.The prime minister’s warning comes as calls for the beleaguered airline to be wound down intensified in the past few weeks. The airline’s woes flared up on March 5 after its sole shareholder Khazanah reported its first annual loss in over a decade, mainly due to a RM3.7 billion writedown of Malaysia Airlines’ value last year.It doesn’t help matters that the airline missed its target to return to the black last year and, according to Centre for Aviation (CAPA) chief analyst and chief representative for Southeast Asia Brendan Sobie, will find it difficult to achieve profitability, at least in the near future, given current market conditions.On March 1, the private company revealed that it finished 2018 with a marginally lower loss compared to a year ago but it did not disclose the figures.Filings with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) show that Malaysia Airlines’ net loss increased by 85% year on year to RM812.11 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY2017). It has lost RM2.35 billion between 2015 and 2017.While it did not disclose its exact revenue for FY2018 except to say that it grew by 1% y-o-y, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that revenue rose to RM8.76 billion from RM8.67 billion in FY2017. It has yet to file its financial statements for FY2018 with SSM.Malaysia Airlines blamed FY2018’s poor performance on crew shortage, intense competition, oversupply of capacity and volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange.It is worth noting that when the 12-point MAS Recovery Plan (MRP) was conceived in 2014, fuel price was US$75.68 per barrel. As at March 8, 2019, the International Air Transport Association jet fuel price monitor was up 3.5% at US$80.30 per barrel from a year ago.The ringgit had also weakened by 3.6% to 4.9% to 4.0910 against the US dollar last Thursday. Khazanah’s assumption under the five-year recovery plan was that the local currency would range from 3.90 to 3.95.Still, critics point to Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, which turned things around with a HK$2.3 billion profit last year after three years of heavy losses and Singapore Airlines (SIA), which managed to turn in a net profit of S$284 million for the third financial quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, amid the challenging operating environment. Khazanah seen more willing to give up the flag carrierAfter not one but four failed attempts at restructuring the national carrier and setting it on a path to sustainable profitability, including during the 42 years when it was known as Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS), the calls are growing louder for the government to shut it down for good.Its weak financial health — even after a RM6 billion injection from Khazanah in 2014 — also makes it a prime target when Malaysia’s new government is looking to trim its huge debt of RM1.087 trillion as at Dec 31, 2018.Indeed, some analysts say the timing of Khazanah’s RM3.7 billion impairment charge on Malaysia Airlines in 2018 is an indication that it may be ready to end or sell its loss-making unit.HLIB Research aviation analyst Daniel Wong notes that Malaysia Airlines is not part of Khazanah’s core portfolio, suggesting that the state investment firm would be willing to part with its airline business if the investment does not make financial sense and assuming government approval is granted.“While we do not doubt Malaysia Airlines is a pride to Malaysia as the national carrier has been around since 1947, we remain doubtful of Khazanah’s willingness and ability to sustain the continued losses of Malaysia Airlines. The losses of Malaysia Airlines may amount to RM1 billion per year,” he says in a March 13 report. Malaysia Airlines can still fly highOnce-troubled flag carriers such as British Airways (BA), Japan Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Qantas Airways are living proof that Malaysia Airlines still has a chance of turning around, says a senior aviation consultant who declined to be named.A multitude of factors have contributed to Malaysia Airlines’ financial woes, but foremost among them is the lack of autonomy to run the business without government intervention, say airline experts and analysts.“There are no obvious or easy solutions and there are so many external factors that will impact Malaysia Airlines’ future financials. However, there are areas for potential improvement,” CAPA’s Sobie tells The Edge.“While the latest restructuring went much deeper than previous attempts, it didn’t go deep enough and address all the legacy issues. The airline could potentially take another crack at reducing its costs but this can only be effective if there is no political interference.“It could also relook its commercial and network strategy. Evolving into more of a regional airline could be an option,” he says.Sobie points out that while shutting down the airline is obviously politically difficult and has never really been an option, it now seems that it is being seriously considered.“There would still be sufficient competition in the market (even with Malaysia Airlines gone) and the void would likely be filled by the existing or new competitors. Keep in mind there were only two (Malaysia-based) players (Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia Group Bhd) before Malindo Airways Sdn Bhd was launched five years ago. However, another restructuring would still likely be the preferred option politically,” he adds.Transport infrastructure consultancy Modalis Infrastructure Partners associate director Khair Mirza believes Malaysia Airlines can thrive given a level playing field.“By definition, GLCs (government-linked companies) need to play a dual role. So, as long as it has a level playing field against other carriers, it can succeed, like how Qantas, Turkish Airlines and Garuda have all succeeded,” he adds.Khair points out that Malaysia Airlines is the only recognised strategic GLC that faces unfettered competition while trying to balance a social equity role. “It’s like asking an elephant to climb up a coconut tree just because the monkey has glorified climbing trees.”Meanwhile, a senior aviation consultant notes that the government must also ensure that Malaysia Airlines has the right people on its board of directors to steer the airline.“The board has had many of the same members for several years despite losses. It is good to have new people with fresh ideas to help move Malaysia Airlines forward.“It is also good to have a combination of some with overall airline industry experience (at least two to three years) and some good professionals in finance and law,” he adds.The consultant also points out that the airline must have the right people in senior management. “Malaysia Airlines CEO Izham Ismail should be given a chance to carry on and he deserves the freedom to name his own team,” he says.Modalis’ Khair concurs, noting that a shake-up of the eight-member board is long overdue.He also believes that it is time to allow Malaysia Airlines to award contracts based on competitive bidding rather than “giving contracts to non-strategic investees that have bloated into public-listed entities, squeezing out bona fide market participants”. A case in point is the RM42.99 million three-year contract bagged by UEM Edgenta Bhd’s 80%-owned subsidiary KFM Holdings Bhd in June 2016 to provide facility management services to Malaysia Airlines via direct negotiation.A check on Malaysia Airlines website reveals that its board comprises one executive director —  Izham — and seven non-executive directors, namely Tan Sri Krishnan Tan Boon Seng, Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa, David Lau Nai Pek, Dr Mohamadon Abdullah, Sheranjiv M Sammanthan, Mohammad Izani Ashari and Ahmad Zulqarnain Che Onn. Foo Shiou Voon is an alternative director for Mohammad Izani.Tan, Lau, Mohamadon and Mohammad Izani have been on the board since August 2015. Tan, Lau and Mohamadon were also directors at the old MAS.An accountant by training, Tan is currently non-executive deputy chairman of IJM Corp Bhd. Zamzamzairani served as the group CEO and managing director of Telekom Malaysia Bhd from April 2008 to April 2017, while Lau has over 35 years of experience in finance and is also a director of Axiata Bhd and Celcom Axiata Bhd. Mohamadon had served MAS for 32 years before retiring on Dec 31, 2004, as senior general manager of corporate services.Meanwhile, four board members — Sheranjiv, Mohammad Izani, Ahmad Zulqarnain and Foo — are Khazanah appointees. Asset sales may offer some reliefHLIB Research’s Wong believes it will be wise for the government to divest Malaysia Airlines or find a strategic partner instead of shutting it down, which will stem the draining of government cash while reducing staff layoff, as the takeover entity will still need a workforce to run the airline.Malaysia Airlines has undergone two rounds of layoffs in the last 13 years. It shed over 6,000 employees in 2006 and 2007 under the Business Turnaround Plan 1 and another 6,000 in 2015 under the MRP. Today. it has a 13,000-strong workforce, which some still consider bloated given its smaller network.A former Malaysia Airlines senior executive says the government should take a leaf from the sale of a 49.9% stake in national carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd to Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.“There won’t be any government interference in the management of the business then.“The entire board and key personnel of Malaysia Airlines must also be replaced. They had the opportunity to revive the airline, but failed. Let others in the private sector (preferably Malaysian) to fix this. It can be done,” he says.“The problems in Malaysia Airlines are obvious; we need the ‘will’ to do it. The government needs to let go of the national airline and let the private sector run it entirely, just like BA and Iberia,” he adds.He is also of the view that Malaysia Airlines’ business units like cargo, engineering, flight catering, ground handling and the loyalty programme should be transformed from cost centres to profit centres where they are responsible for their own revenues, costs and resulting profits.“These units should be looked at as standalone businesses. They  can then grow and expand without being held back by the passenger business.”Malaysia Airlines’ FY2017 financial statements show that its cargo revenue stood at just RM551.27 million, a far cry from the RM1.66 billion reported in FY2013.Its engineering services business has also been scaled down from a world-renowned player in the maintenance, repair and overhaul market under MAS Aerospace Engineering to a purely self-supporting unit today. Airport handling and engineering services revenue stood at RM49.34 million in FY2017 compared with RM256.86 million in FY2013. Note:Following the publication of this story, UEM Edgenta Bhd has clarified that Malaysia Airlines Bhd had conducted an open tender process for the RM42.99 million three-year facility management services contract covering specific parts of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and its Kelana Jaya academy in Petaling Jaya, and not via direct negotiation as reported.The open tender process saw the participation of several facility management service providers including KFM Holdings Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of UEM Edgenta, UEM Edgenta said in a statement.It noted that Malaysia Airlines undertook a request for information in May 2015, followed by a request for proposal in July 2015 and commercial clarification.""In the final round, KFM along with two other facilities management service providers were shortlisted. KFM was informed of the contract award in February 2016 and it was completed in December 2018,"" it said.For related story, see: Overcapacity sends Malaysia Airlines further into turbulence",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/why-does-malaysia-airlines-keep-failing-%E2%80%94-and-there-way-stop-it
